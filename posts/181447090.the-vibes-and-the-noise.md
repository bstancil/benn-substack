**A programming note:*** Have you ever thought, “These blog posts are alright, but I wish that they were longer and louder? Well. This post was adapted from a recent talk, so if you’re sick of mere metaphorical yelling and would prefer actual yelling, there is a video of that [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7zcwFSu4HU). Like and subscribe.*

Here is what happened to Jordan Chiles:

At the beginning of Section I of the *Code of Points*, the document declares its purpose: “To provide an objective means of evaluating gymnastics exercises.” Section II defines the rights of the gymnast in this evaluation; the very first right—article 2.1.1a—is the right to have performances judged correctly and fairly.

Which demands the obvious question: Despite the 400 pages of rigor and quantified rules, was this competition judged correctly? Was it objective? For all three women involved, does anything about this result seem fair?

And how did all of this even happen?

# The quantification of everything

You could answer that question in two ways. The proximate cause of last year’s mess was another, [similar mess in 2004](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/22/sports/summer-2004-games-gymnastics-all-around-judges-suspended-for-error-but-hamm-will.html), in which a scoring error—also about an incorrectly assessed deduction—cost Yang Tae Young, a South Korean gymnast, the gold medal in men’s Olympic all-around. FIG [overhauled the scoring system](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/06/sports/olympics/06scoring.html) after that, replacing the traditional “perfect ten” framework with the new, more mathematical *Code of Points*.

But the *Code of Points* could also be explained as part of a larger narrative: The quantification of everything. Because, in the late 2000s and early 2010s, [numbers became our inexorable future](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html):

> “It’s a revolution,” says Gary King, director of Harvard’s Institute for Quantitative Social Science. “We’re really just getting under way. But the march of quantification, made possible by enormous new sources of data, will sweep through academia, business and government. There is no area that is going to be untouched.”

Hedge fund managers no longer bet on their intuition, but [on their models](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/magazine/the-quantitative-databased-riskmassaging-road-to-riches.html). Sports teams [did the same](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball:_The_Art_of_Winning_an_Unfair_Game). Political pundits were out; [Nate Silver was in](https://hbr.org/2012/11/how-nate-silver-won-the-2012-p). He launched [FiveThirtyEight as an entire media division](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/9499752/nate-silver-joins-espn-multifaceted-role), to bring their “data-driven approach into new areas.” We quantified [companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/business/24unboxed.html), [elections](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/big-data-and-the-u-s-presidential-campaign/), and [ourselves](https://www.wired.com/2009/06/lbnp-knowthyself/). And, gymnastics.

As a sub-trend: We also wrote blog posts about everything that we could graph: [Our sleep](https://web.archive.org/web/20140905235023/https://jawbone.com/blog/napa-earthquake-effect-on-sleep/); our [commutes](https://mode.com/blog/daylight-savings-commute); our [mortality](https://web.archive.org/web/20170331211359/https://deadspin.com/feel-old-with-our-how-many-pro-athletes-are-younger-th-1565829499). Writing in the *New York Times*, [Seth Stephens-Davidowitz](https://benn.substack.com/p/playing-for-ourselves#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20week,who%20excels%20there.) looked at the numbers [behind our musical preferences](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/opinion/sunday/favorite-songs.html). He found that our tastes are overwhelmingly defined by what was popular when we were teenagers. More recently, the *Washington Post*’s “Department of Data” [extended the idea](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/24/when-america-was-great-according-data/), and found that the same pattern holds for nearly everything: Fashion, movies, television, sporting events, food—all of it, we said, was better in our adolescence.

Of course, there is no “best fashion.” There are only fads, and the generational indoctrination that makes us believe that our fad was the best one. With things like clothes, no matter how militantly we believe that we looked cool and that the Kids These Days look dumb, it is easy to see how fickle fashion can be. It is easy to see that, as our styles fade into obsolescence, the next generation is not wrong; we are just growing old.

But other trends can be harder to recognize as trends. For example: What makes a good employee? What are the right ways to think, and make decisions? What is the best way to answer an ambiguous question like which of these products, or baseball players, or gymnastics routines, is best?

If you came of *professional *age in the 2000s and 2010s, your answer—per the same trend that created Stephens-Davidowitz’s research—is to be data-driven. But is that answer right—is it the “best method”?—or do we simply believe that is, because that was the corporate philosophy that we were indoctrinated into? Was the quantification of social science—and business, and culture, and sport—a revolution, or was it just a fad too?

# The new revolutionaries

When this all started, 15 years ago, there was clout in data work. It was urgent; it was prestigious; it was strategic; it was, dare we say it, *cool*:

> Sterrett saw analytics as “pre-eminently the profession of business advice” and the analyst as a person who “is thoroughly conversant with the principles” underlying a successful company and who “has accumulated a large fund of information in…business policy.”

And:

> Stettler believed that the prestige of the data profession would grow to match and surpass that of the older, more recognized professions of law and medicine, and that data scientists would outnumber physicians and lawyers.

But cool never lasts. Because those two quotes aren’t actually about analytics and data science; they are about accounting, from [1904](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2005/oct/100yearsofthejournal) and [1968](https://www.nysscpa.org/news/publications/the-cpa-journal/article-detail?ArticleID=11611). And accountants, critical as they are, are rarely in charge these days. They are fact-checkers, not decision-makers. They are the part of the corporate machine that someone else drives.

For analytics, [the path seems similar](https://benn.substack.com/i/137070616/die-a-hero-or-live-long-enough-to-become-an-accountant). A generation grew up reading *The Signal and the Noise* and *Thinking Fast and Slow*, and bludgeoned the prior generation to death with models and [quantitative rhetoric](https://benn.substack.com/i/41161485/the-reverence-for-quantitative-rhetoric) and complex codes of points. In God we trusted; [all others must bring data](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/in-god-we-trust-all-others-must-bring-data).

No longer. Anu Atluru is right: [Taste is eating Silicon Valley](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/taste-is-eating-silicon-valley). Craft, not data, is the new buzzword. Linear CEO Karri Saarinen, whose company has built one [most copied brands](https://web.archive.org/web/20250415171457/https://www.linears.art/) of the 2020s, [recommended that startups](https://x.com/karrisaarinen/status/1845201572533256432) “ban use of data as a decision making tool.” “Don’t make decisions based on data or experiments,” [he told Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/karri-saarinens-10-rules-for-crafting-products-that-stand-out/); “to design with craft, you must develop and trust your intuition.” The former dean of Harvard Business School—whose associated publication, the *Harvard Business Review*, has published hundreds of articles on the [urgency of becoming data-driven](https://hbr.org/search?search_type=search-all&term=data-driven)—[said earlier this year](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/06/good-taste-ai/683101/) that “good taste is more important than ever.” Nobody wants to be a [data nerd](https://x.com/newrelic/status/646824479696420864) anymore; we all want to be a [tastemaker](https://x.com/claudeai/status/1974193032531517950).[^4]

Anecdotally, this seems especially true inside of AI companies, which are quickly becoming corporate trendsetters. The enthusiasm that SaaS startups had for analytics, experimentation, and rigorous quantitative thinking has been almost wholly replaced by a demand for people with taste and “agency.” One popular AI company—employing hundreds, used by millions, making hundreds of millions—has *one* person dedicated to data work. They have formal evals to measure how their product is performing, they said, but decisions are ultimately made based on how new features *feel*.

None of this is to say that data is going away. But it is falling out of fashion.[^5] It is fading into the background. In data we trusted; now, God is in the vibes.

# Quantity has a quality all its own

But that story is incomplete. Even if vibe-driven decision-making is ascendant, how do we figure out those vibes? Business people need to know what’s happening with their businesses. Politicians need to know what voters think. Judges need to score a gymnastics routine. If not with numbers, then what?

On the second page of the *Code of Points*, there is an ad. It is for the [Fujitsu 3D Sensing and AI Judging Support System](https://www.rdworldonline.com/ai-assisted-gymnastics-judging-system/):

> The Judging Support System (JSS) employs a multi-step process to analyze gymnastic performances. It begins by capturing 3D data of the athletes’ movements without the use of physical markers. AI-powered pose estimation algorithms then identify and track the position of the gymnasts’ joints throughout their routines. …
> To understand the details of gymnastic routines, the AI powering the JSS learned from a database of 8,000 routines. … The system can discern differences between elements, transitions, and pauses, as well as its understanding of the specific criteria for deductions based on deviations from the ideal execution. …
> In addition to providing near real-time feedback to judges—identifying elements, calculating scores, and flagging deductions—JSS can be used by gymnasts and coaches to analyze performances and refine skills.

If AI is good at anything, it is good at interpreting the vibes. It is good at aggregating massive amounts of text—and increasingly, of video and audio—into its approximate average. Give it your support tickets and customer communications, and [ask it questions about what it read](https://hightouch.com/blog/hightouch-agents-ai-for-marketers). Don’t classify and categorize images; [just ask an AI model what it thinks it sees](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/sql/language-manual/functions/ai_query#:~:text=the%20image%20file.-,SQL,what%20is%20this%20image%20about%3F%27%2C%20files%20%3D%3E%20content),-as%20output%20FROM). Don’t argue about steps on landings and timestamps when protests are filed; just have a robot watch the routine, compare it to thousands of others, and have it spit out how it deviated from the ideal execution. Ask it for the vibes.

The old generation might protest—this is not objective! This is not rigorous! There is nuance and bias in these questions, and “vibes” is just another word for hocus pocus punditry!

Maybe—though we would say that; it’s our whole bit. But regardless of our arguments’ merits, do we really think it’s going to keep winning? When a CEO asks us how a new product is doing, which answer will they prefer?

Is the second answer right? *It almost doesn’t matter.* As, uh, [Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbreaking:_The_Worst_Person_You_Know_Just_Made_a_Great_Point) once [said](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/795954-quantity-has-a-quality-all-its-own), “quantity has a quality all its own.”[^6] If you make something accessible and compelling enough—Wikipedia over Encarta; news on social media over news in the paper; ChatGPT over manual searches; immediate answers describing the vibes over legalistic answers about numerical minutiae—that’s where people will turn.

And then, it becomes self-reinforcing. The more that people use Wikipedia, the better it gets. Similarly, the more CEOs ask about their customers’ vibes, the more effort we’ll go to to understand them. When numbers were in demand, we built a giant, sprawling network of suppliers to collect, store, transform, and aggregate them. If the new bosses demand vibes, [we’ll find the suppliers](https://benn.substack.com/p/producer-theory) and build them a vibe stack.

# Vibe native

Ask data people what teams need to do to prepare for the next era of analytics, and they will tell you about the importance of building semantic ontologies for AI agents. They will talk about context engineering, and metadata management, and the supreme importance of data quality. They will talk about the layers of technologies that need to get created to make sure that AI agents compute metrics consistently and accurately. They will talk about the various things that companies need to invest in tomorrow, so that data teams can make good on the promises that they made yesterday. All we need, they might say, is to finally build a better code of points.

It is so much work to do all of this, and it takes [a lot of faith](https://x.com/seanjtaylor/status/1433636587699539996) to believe in it. Why should the next generation will have that faith? They were raised on taste, [aura farming](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/style/aura-farming-indonesia-boat-kid.html), and ChatGPT’s instant answers. Their politicians—Trump, Mamdani—won on instinct and [aesthetic](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/opinion/zohran-mamdani-aesthetic-new-york.html). Their heroes on Twitter are the [menswear guy](https://x.com/dieworkwear?lang=en), not Nate Silver. Their startups were more founder-mode than data-driven; their success came from their [agency](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/ai-is-a-boon-to-high-agency-people-entrepreneur-replit-cb495999) and not their analytical reasoning. They are [vibe native](https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/trends/2025/12/12/aesthetic-gen-z-meaning).

For those of us who are still trying to build a data-driven world, that may be the only context that matters: We can keep trying to bring data, but in vibes they trust.
