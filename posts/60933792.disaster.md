*This man is in charge, for the rest of his life.*

I had something else to talk about this morning. It was the usual silliness—something about the curious irony of analytics engineering, and a few jokes about Excel and people in San Francisco.

Today, all of the sudden, [isn't the day](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court) to tell those jokes. In what is fast becoming its [new tradition](https://benn.substack.com/p/tilt-and-tilted), the Supreme Court decided again to impose its deranged will on an [unapproving populace](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx), stripping people of [the rights they want](https://www.wsj.com/articles/upholding-roe-v-wade-is-supported-by-most-americans-wsj-poll-finds-11654162200) (to say nothing of what the rights they’re owed), transparently [inventing legal rationales](https://twitter.com/lib_crusher/status/1539999857611485184) along the way, all while its most vile member—a man with such a feeble commitment to his oath of office law that [he clearly entertained](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/us/trump-emails-eastman-chesebro-jan-6.html) not only rejecting the apparent public opinion of the people, but the voted, counted, and certified [will of the electorate](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/us/politics/ginni-thomas-election-trump.html)—teased that [more is to come](https://twitter.com/Taniel/status/1540341232081174528).  The arc of the moral universe is long, and it bends toward whatever loathsome destination six unelected and unaccountable [politicians](https://twitter.com/bennstancil/status/1521501078281408512) [want it to](https://twitter.com/Kate_Riga24/status/1540356238164348931).

Next week, we can return to having jovial fights about our comfortable industry. But on this Friday, I don't have much to say, other than it's a disastrous day, created by six disastrous people, confirmed by a [disastrous idiot](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/sen-collins-completely-inconsistent-gorsuch-kavanaugh-support-overturn-rcna27099), and empowered by what has become a [disastrous institution](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bowie-SCOTUS-Testimony.pdf). To those of you who showed up looking for cranky heckling and a goofier affair, I appreciate you, truly. But today, [read something else](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/07/04/we-are-not-going-back-to-the-time-before-roe-we-are-going-somewhere-worse).
