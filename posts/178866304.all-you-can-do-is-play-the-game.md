# All you can do is play the game

*I don’t know what’s coming next.*

When someone says “I don’t know,” what does it mean? [There are levels to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvTRZJ-4EyI&t=62s):

Anyway, this is a blog that’s ostensibly about tech, and to be a blog in Good Standing in Silicon Valley—or a podcast, or a Twitter talking head, or a useful guest on a conference panel—we’re supposed to talk about the future. That’s the preferred direction of our discourse: Forward. Looking ahead. What’s newly dead? What’s coming; what’s next? What will be [the new new thing](https://www.amazon.com/New-Thing-Silicon-Valley-Story/dp/0393347818)? What [big change is happening in the world](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/greatest-sales-deck-ive-ever-seen-andy-raskin/)?

This is also a blog that’s ostensibly about data, so here are some things that could happen in the data industry:

Though these stories aren’t exactly mutually exclusive, they aren’t quite compatible either. It doesn’t make sense to build specialized chatbots if we feed everything into Claude; it doesn’t make sense to give analysts a blinged-out IDE if nobody hires analysts to answer questions anymore.

So which one wins? I don’t know, and man, it’s a full Gregory Olinovich.

Because if there is a single story that explains how AI changes the world, it is that it happens by accident. ChatGPT—the [most valuable](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-lays-groundwork-juggernaut-ipo-up-1-trillion-valuation-2025-10-29/) AI product in the world, and the one that is [turning the entire internet into a chatbot](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/)—was a last minute project hacked together by a [group of volunteers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixY2PvQJ0To&t=964s) at a research lab. Nobody thought too hard about use cases or ideal customers; nobody asked how big Gartner predicted the market for chatbots would be; there was no two-by-two matrix of competitors. To the extent that there was a grand plan for ChatGPT, it was to launch it, and then [shut it down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixY2PvQJ0To&t=1004s).

Almost certainly, whatever changes happen in the data world over the next five years will also happen because of similar accidents. People have already tried to build that entire list of products in the previous section, with varying degrees of success. But will the [next model release](https://www.testingcatalog.com/gemini-3-spotted-again-as-google-readies-its-release/) suddenly make one of them work? Will the next startup that tries to make an analytical chatbot [make an interface for it that people unexpectedly love](https://benn.substack.com/p/a-strange-delight)? Will someone hack together an automated business analyst with just the right incantations in their prompts, and it starts to work? As soon as one of these dominos fall, an army of new startups with rush towards that timeline, like [moths towards a flame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJN9mBRX3uo&t=228s).

If the swarms of agents work, suddenly dozens of companies will try to build ways to make it cheaper to run thousands of queries all at once. If semantic ontologies and context engineering make chatbots useful, the context layer will become [the next powder keg](https://benn.substack.com/p/powder-keg?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=The%20biggest%20looming%20battle%2C%20however%2C%20will%20be%20over%20a%20different%20territory%3A%20The%20brain%E2%80%94or%20operating%20system%E2%80%94of%20the%20data%20stack.%C2%A0) in IT software. If someone finds answers in messy buckets of text and video files, a hundred data pipeline companies will chase that heat. Or, more generally, the entire analytical world—and probably, every other software vertical—depends on which random breakthrough happens first.

So what do you do, when the winners are chosen by lottery?

There is a lesson I learn every Thursday night, and forget by Saturday morning: To figure out what a blog post is about, you have to write it first. You might think that it goes the other way—an idea starts in your head, it becomes an outline on a piece of paper, and then a blog post on the internet—but that’s never how it works. Epiphanies come from typing, not thinking.

Analogously, in a way—Cursor was founded by [recent college graduates](https://www.wearefounders.uk/cursor-founders-the-mit-team-behind-the-400-million-ai-code-editor-revolution/). They were not hardened engineers who’d [Seen Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoAzpa1x7jU&t=108s); they were not part of some corporate [mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia). They probably didn’t have a detailed corporate business plan about wedges, growth strategies, marketing channels, or their [second step](https://benn.substack.com/p/trading-places#:~:text=For%20other%20startups,in%20the%20sand.). Instead, they were a few engineers who primarily differentiated themselves among the millions of other engineers who had the same idea—“what if someone put a chatbot inside of VSCode?”—by being the ones who built it. Though Cursor no doubt did some clever things, the most important thing was that they did it at all.

[Generational riches](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-ai-coding-startup-favored-by-tech-ceos-is-now-worth-29-3-billion-14c72c02), it turns out, also starts with typing, not thinking.

There’s a scene in *Margin Call* where Jeremy Irons, who’s playing the hardened CEO of titanic bank on the cusp of collapsing in the acute hours of 2008 financial crisis, [contemplates his mortality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fij_ixfjiZE&t=297s):

> Do you know why I’m in this chair? I’m here for one reason, and one reason alone: I’m here to guess what the music might do one week, one month, one year from now. That’s it. Nothing more. And standing here tonight, I’m afraid that I don’t. hear. a. thing. Just...silence.

If you work in tech for long enough, you, like Jeremy Irons, will begin to hear the music. You learn the realities of life in the trenches. You see the mistakes that everyone repeats. You talk to customers in whatever market you specialize in; you will hear of their troubles. You begin to see the patterns; you pick up on the chorus and common refrains; [you](https://benn.substack.com/p/everything-is-still-bi) hear [the](https://benn.substack.com/p/no-really-everything-becomes-bi) way [it](https://benn.substack.com/i/171672882/everything-becomes-bi) all [rhymes](https://benn.substack.com/i/174032155/msnbc-becomes-bi). You develop an intuition, and that intuition becomes your edge. The kids might work harder, but if you can hear the music, you can work smarter.

Unfortunately, there is no music right now. The fog of AI—the wild randomness of today’s technological developments and of which products catch a viral updraft and which don’t—have silenced it. No IDC report on market sizing matters; no engineering fundamentals will save you when engineering becomes [industrialized](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-industrialization-of-it); no SaaS playbook works when nobody can say for sure that [SaaS will even be around](https://benn.substack.com/p/saas-20) in ten years. Perhaps, no *experience* even matters. There is no such thing as a long term plan. There is just step one, and how you respond when the market tilts under your feet, and some new technical change punches you in the face.

An odd fact about the internet is that we’re all a few clicks or keystrokes from incomprehensible power and wealth. Right now, if you log into Robinhood and click on a few buttons in the right order, you could retire next week. Type a few thousand of the right characters into a code editor, and you’ll end up pulling the technical strings that control the world. Sure, the odds of that happening are small, but it is still strange—we are all one fifteen minute fugue state from owning an island.

What are those characters though? Obviously, nobody knows. But now, more than ever, it seems like the only way to find them—no matter who you are, whether that’s a grizzled veteran or at college student—it is to start typing.

[^2]: By which I mean, it refuses to answer your questions until you tell it why you’re asking them.

[^3]: I have no idea if either of these tools are good, but one of them lists a bunch of trending Kalshi bets underneath its chatbot that promises “faster insights and smarter decisions,” so, you know.
