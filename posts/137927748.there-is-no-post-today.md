According to Substack, 148 of this blog’s subscribers live in Israel. Three more live in Palestine. I hope that all of you are safe, that your family and friends are safe, and that the people driving what is happening in both Israel and Gaza insist on mercy for the innocent as much as they do justice for the guilty. 

That’s all I have to say today—the [planned post](https://benn.substack.com/p/does-venture-capital-ruin-great-products#:~:text=But%20the%20first%20one%20is%20at%20least%20as%20interesting%2C%20and%20will%20probably%20be%20what%20next%20week%E2%80%99s%20post%20is%20about.%C2%A0) can wait. This week, if you’re one of the 151 people in the middle of this spiraling nightmare, the microphone is yours.[^1]

[^1]: To be honest, I’m not entirely sure what I mean by this. But if you’re currently living in Israel or Palestine, and you have a story you want to share with the people who read this blog, or a perspective that everyone is missing—or even, like, a take on data or a product to sell or a Soundcloud to promote—[email me](https://benn.substack.com/about), and we’ll figure it out.
