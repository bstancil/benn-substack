*Bill Watterson doesn’t care about your aggregation theory.*

You know you’ve thought about it:

It’s all a bit weirder than that, though, because the “standards” are circular. Notion ingests conversations from Slack; Slack ingests documents from Notion; both use [OpenAI](https://www.salesforce.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/documents/legal/misc/salesforce-infrastructure-and-subprocessors.pdf) or [Anthropic](https://www.notion.so/notion/Notion-s-List-of-Subprocessors-268fa5bcfa0f46b6bc29436b21676734) to provide their AI features, which themselves both offer native connectors to ingest [conversations](https://chatgpt.com/features/connectors/) from Slack and [documents](https://www.claude.com/connectors) from Notion. The [Jasper AI platform](https://www.jasper.ai/platform) learns how to write ads for you by learning from those same documents, and then [makes that context available to other products](https://www.jasper.ai/mcp), like bots that write copy in, again, those documents. [Lots](https://www.poggio.io/platform) of [startups](https://briefhq.ai/) aggregate and integrate context together, and then make it available via MCP, to be consumed by another product that will aggregate and integrate it again. It’s platforms, [all the way down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWx6csgGkg4).

You could have a couple theories about all of this, I suppose. One is that integrating all of this data together is extremely valuable, and that the rush to do it—according to *The Information*, [every major enterprise software company](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/snowflake-sierra-every-enterprise-software-firm-selling-ai-agents) is building an “enterprise search” agent—is a very sensible war for a very strategic space. Google became the [fourth biggest company](https://companiesmarketcap.com/) in the world by being the front door for the internet; of course everyone wants to be the [front door for work](https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-09-16-Workday-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Sana#:~:text=Workday%20the%20new-,front%20door%20for%20work,-%2C%20delivering%20a%20proactive). And this messiness is just an intermediate state, until someone wins or [we all run out of money](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/nvidia-earnings-ai-stock-market-af933127?mod=hp_lead_pos3).

A second theory, however, is that platforms aren’t as valuable as we think they are. For a decade now, Silicon Valley has come to accept, nearly as a matter of law, that the [aggregators are the internet’s biggest winners](https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/). But aggregation theory[^5] assumes that production flows cleanly from left to right: From producers, to distributors, to consumers, with the potential for gatekeepers along the way. “Context”—especially if MCP succeeds in making it easy for one tool to talk to another—is not like that. Slack aggregates what Notion knows; Notion aggregates what Slack knows; ChatGPT aggregates what everyone knows, and everyone uses ChatGPT to aggregate everything. Producers are consumers, consumers become producers, and everyone is a distributor. There aren’t people orderly walking into one big front door; there are agents crisscrossing through hundreds of side doors.

In that telling, the right analogy for context isn’t content, but knowledge. Because what is context, anyway? It could be a pileup of Google Docs and emails, but it’s also things that are *derived *from that information—the preferences of how someone manages their meetings, and the unspoken style guide that’s implied from a thousand marketing emails, and the loosely combined summaries of what employees are saying in engagement surveys.

If you squint at these context ecosystems, they are a bunch of tools that are trying to learn from each other. The most valuable nodes aren’t the tools that aggregate the most information and offer it up for easy consumption, but the ones that push the most new intelligence back to the group—either by being a unique source of raw information, or by learning clever new things from other people’s information.

Arguably, that’s what a lot of these tools are already doing—some are [collecting](https://www.granola.ai/), and some aggregating and enriching, or aggregating and compressing.[^6] But in our obsession with becoming platforms, we might be surprised by how valuable it is to stay “just” a producer.

[^4]: There are variants to this story, of course. Some companies start as natural [aggregators](https://hightouch.com/) of [data](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-intelligence-brings-agentic-AI-to-the-enterprise/#:~:text=Snowflake%20Intelligence%20unifies%20all%20enterprise%20data%20sources%20from%20structured%20tables%20and%20unstructured%20documents%20to%20data%20from%20third%2Dparty%20apps%20like%20Salesforce%20Data%20360%20via%20Zero%20Copy.), and [softly pivot](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2021/09/15/glean-startup-emerges-from-stealth-enterprise-search-assistant/) into becoming [context layers](https://atlan.com/) for AI. Some companies already host valuable information, like documents or conversations, and begin [incorporating other sources](https://slack.com/features/enterprise-search) into their [products’ search](https://www.notion.com/product/enterprise-search). Some companies are [really big](https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-09-16-Workday-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Sana), and buy some [connectors](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/11/18/salesforce-completes-acquisition-of-informatica/) and a [search engine](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-doti/).

[^5]: I can’t succinctly explain aggregation theory because I’ve never quite understood aggregation theory, but to do the best I can: Before the internet, distribution was expensive, so consumers had limited choice, so suppliers, who controlled or owned distribution channels, had a lot of market power. After the internet, distribution was cheap, so consumers had tons of choice, so aggregators—companies like Google that sat between consumers and suppliers, and could control or influence what they chose—had all the power.

[^6]: Which could be a disaster, I should say. Every tool reads from the same primary sources, they all “learn” from each other, their confusion compounds, and the enterprise agentic workforce is a [blurry JPEG](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web) of two Google Docs.
