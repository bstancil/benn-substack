*A young man.*

When Lou Gehrig was 36 years and 15 days old, he delivered his [famous retirement speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Gehrig#%22The_luckiest_man_on_the_face_of_the_earth%22)—“today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth”—at Yankee Stadium. I know this because I heard a [clip from the speech](https://twitter.com/jtabrys/status/1597972559311798272) on Wednesday and, wanting to see the rest of it, found [a recording on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNLKPaThYkE). My immediate reaction from watching the video was not, as it usually is, to be shaken by the wrenching tragedy of the moment, but to think, “Oh no, he looks young.” Lou Gehrig is supposed to be centuries old, a weathered patriarch, an elder statesmen, an iron man, a granite legend. He is not supposed to look suitable to cast in *[Too Hot to Handle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Hot_to_Handle_(TV_series))*. 

I looked up how old he was during that speech: 36 years, 15 days. A couple weeks past my 36th birthday, an unsettling thought crossed my mind: How old am *I*? The answer, as fate would cruelly have it, was 36 years, 14 days. Which means the answer today, if my math is right, is now [36 years, 16 days](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?m1=11&d1=16&y1=1986&m2=12&d2=2&y2=2022). 

Wrenching stuff, indeed.

So off I went, looking up how old other people were at important moments in their lives. Dozens of celebrities later, I found myself with an leaderboard of accomplishments and disasters, of crimes and deaths, of first appearances and new relationships, with me steadily climbing it, like LeBron [marching up the all-time points list](https://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/34584960/when-lebron-james-break-nba-career-points-record). Next up, James Madison drafting much of the Constitution at 36 years and 185 days old, and Blackbeard pirating his first ship at 36 years and 244 days old. 

Until then, [do your own calculus](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html), and join me in making 101 comparisons that never needed to be made.
