*[John Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore))*

Here is some rough math:

Which one would be more productive?

The answer is *probably *the engineer. A single model running in a never-ending loop could write a lot of code—about a billion lines of it, using this math—but it would be awfully unwieldy. It would paint itself into a lot of corners. It would make [grave security errors](https://x.com/leojr94_/status/1901560276488511759). It wouldn’t know what to build, convince itself that [it needs to escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-azo4BNMf4), and melt down.

Still, it’s not *that* obvious that the lone engineer would be better. How many new features could a junior engineer ship in a year, working entirely on their own? Would they work *that* well, and be *that* technically robust? Would the engineer know what to build that much better than AI that was told to create stuff based on its best assumptions for what would make a popular product? Which technical ceilings would they hit that Gemini wouldn’t?

And how many features could Gemini ship across *two million* prompts? At that volume, you can break out of a lot of debugging loops. You can do a lot of refactors and rewrites. Though it would be fitful progress, you can still cover a lot of ground taking 100 steps forward and 99 steps backwards if you do it two million times.

But ok, sure, assume the engineer beats Deep Blue. That’s all well and good; our jobs are still safe. Except, the setup for this scenario—the unencumbered engineer versus today’s models, supported by today’s infrastructure—is as favorable for the engineer as it will ever be. In the coming months and years, nearly everything will work against them and help the robots:

In 2025, the engineer probably beats Gemini. Sure, great. But in 2030, who wins this hypothetical?

I mean! This is not close! The potential energy of the second system is astronomically higher than the first. It is perhaps hard to see, because we don’t know how to harness it—the only thing more inconceivable than the amount of horsepower in something making 800 prompts a second is imagining how to make that horsepower productive.

But it is also inconceivable that we don’t figure that out. As a loose analogy, imagine telling someone from 1900 that we’ve invented a way to do millions of basic mathematical computations a second. *I* barely get why that’s useful, outside of some abstract understanding that that’s how computers work. But the potential energy in that basic process, repeated at incredible scale by a system designed around that capability, now powers the entire world.

Though LLMs are obviously different from simple [floating point operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point_operations_per_second), the foundational principle is the same: They are machines that can perform some logical computation over and over and over again, much faster than we can do it ourselves. And that doesn’t need to develop into some [superintelligence](https://ai-2027.com/race#narrative-2027-09-30) for it to be useful; we just need to figure out how to compound those operations in a single direction.

As nifty as vibe coding is, [its critics](https://nmn.gl/blog/dangers-vibe-coding) are probably [correct](https://x.com/charliermarsh/status/1897332861524709789) that it’s a toy. But that doesn’t necessarily mean code-writing agents are *only* toys any more than it implies that simple adding machines are toys. It just means that we put the right infrastructure around them to scale their computations.

But that’s what’s next, right? It’s not waiting for OpenAI to release an engineer in a box; it’s figuring out how to make almost three million hourly responses from an AI productive. It’s figuring out how to *industrialize* AI.

How might that work? There are ways:

Like, I get it. Today, if you’re an engineer, your job is nuanced, strategic, and creative. There is craft in software development, and an LLM’s derivative brain is not as imaginative as yours. Its hands aren’t as precise. It clumsily trips over itself. It doesn’t think the way you do. The machine is a useful assistant; a copilot; an intern; a power tool that still needs to be driven by the hands of skilled craftsmen. [It will be the labor; you will be the management](https://www.reddit.com/r/calvinandhobbes/comments/1e6risg/calvin_and_susie_in_the_library/). Your work will be more fun, less toil, and higher value. Haven’t I ever heard of [Jevons paradox](https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox)?

Please. That is awfully wishful thinking. The work of software engineering has never been precious. No matter how much we romanticize the importance of creativity and craft in software development, developers are often *hired* as cogs.[^13] When companies want to ship more product, they [hire](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/omni-is-designing-tools-to-help-companies-make-data-driven-decisions/#:~:text=Zima%20said%20the,year%20with%20150.) [more](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/tessell-snags-60m-to-drive-data-management-at-scale/#:~:text=invest%20more%20in%20R%26D%20to%20strengthen%20its%20services) [cogs](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/microsoft-backs-solve-intelligence-in-12m-series-a-funding/#:~:text=The%20startup%20will%20use%20the%20Series%20A%20proceeds%20to%20scale%20its%20product%2C%20hire%20staff%2C%20and%20open%20a%20new%20office%20in%20New%20York%20this%20year.). They hire managers to oversee the production floor, and invest in tools and infrastructure that tighten how quickly the cogs produce stuff.

In other words, in the eyes of our corporate overlords, engineering departments already are factories—but expensive, organic ones. The cogs have to be taken care of. They have to be recruited, hired, and retained. They don’t scale linearly, but logarithmically, or even asymptotically. They want [autonomy, mastery, and purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us). They sometimes quit in a huff. They need sleep, food, meals, preferably free ones. They get caught up in capers and [spy on you](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/the-affidavit-of-a-rippling-employee-caught-spying-for-deel-reads-like-a-movie/).

If the ruthless hand of the market can replace that factory with a mechanized one, it will. If it can run its factories 24 hours a day, it will. If it can replace expensive engineers[ with “downskilled” mechanics](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matthewknopp_derek-guy-dieworkwear-on-x-activity-7314508721668116480-hxv-/), it will. If it can replace artisan, hand-crafted, “proudly made in the Mission” software with an industrialized product stamped out of machines in [Dublin, Ohio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3NGepZbpAk), it will. Yes, a [warehouse of panel saws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vVqPP2C8so) is not as precise as the woodworker. Looms are not as intricate as weavers. The [photographic industry](https://www.csus.edu/indiv/o/obriene/art109/readings/11%20baudelaire%20photography.htm#:~:text=As%20the%20photographic%20industry%20was%20the%20refuge%20of%20every%20would%2Dbe%20painter%2C%20every%20painter%20too%20ill%2Dendowed%20or%20too%20lazy%20to%20complete%20his%20studies%2C) “was the refuge of every would-be painter, every painter too ill-endowed or too lazy to complete his studies.” [Printed books](https://williamwolff.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/TrithemiusScribes.pdf) “will never be the equivalent of handwritten codices, especially since printed books are often deficient in spelling and appearance.”

But they are all cheap to make and cheap to buy, and man, we love cheap. 

If we think that software engineering is protected from industrialization because there’s craft in the work, I think we’re in for a brutal surprise.[^14] The steam engine didn’t kill John Henry because its hammer was more talented than his hands; it killed him because it was relentless. That’s how mechanization works—not by making a machine as capable as a human, but by making a machine that simply does not stop, and then building a factory around it.

It’s the [bitter lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html), all over again. The dominant conglomerates of the future won’t be the companies that build software with humanoid agents, but those that figure out how to run the computing machine at a massive scale.[^15] They will figure out how to put coding agents on a perpetual loop, in a factory that doesn’t have to sleep or take vacations.[^16] They will be the companies that industrialize the most, and optimize for ACPE—average compute per employee. They will be the ones that turn engineers into factory supervisors who watch the line, look for defects, and doze off to the dull hum of the machinery that replaced them.

# The White Lotus Power Rankings

The Ratliff redemption tour!

After the [second episode](https://benn.substack.com/i/158597799/the-white-lotus-power-rankings), the Ratliffs accounted for 71 percent of the show’s most deplorable characters, and 39 percent of its charming characters (almost all of which was, correctly, Victoria). After the seventh episode—which was the next to last one, not the final one—they accounted for only 14 percent of its deplorability, and 47 percent of its charm. Saxon especially turned things around, slashing -50/+4 on deplorable/charm split after [week one](https://benn.substack.com/i/158116384/the-white-lotus-power-rankings), and -5/+19 this week.

Also, more importantly:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!z94E!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9d43d1d-3734-4eb4-8bd8-18c7d03b8805_1330x582.png)

As for predicting the murder, I’m sure you’re all wonderful and smart people, but please do not become detectives. The *[ redacted *five* dead people ]* got a grand total of 11 percent of the vote, and *[ the redacted primary instigator of the shooting ]* got *ZERO* votes. I guess you could make the case that the real killer is Gaitok or, in a way, via a culinary stray, Tim, but those seem pretty generous.

Still, the results are muddy. Who actually was the murderer? Who was the body? Based on the timeline of the shooting, and when the body in the opening scene floats by, I *think* the right answers are:

But that’s no fun, and isn’t really what anybody was asking when they asked, “who will die this season?” So, I think the spiritually correct answers are:

Disagree? Vote! Vote for who you think should be considered the killer and the body, for the sake of crowning a winner! Vote for your final deplorable rankings! Could *[ the redacted primary instigator of the shooting ]* be the most deplorable, the most charming, the killer, and the body, all in one?

[Vote!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LS7Kz72pceBEkyc-Z5LrVcW28ZocjX8MpM3SlvfXiTc/viewform?edit_requested=true)

[^1]: This is slightly more than the [previous version of Gemini Pro](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing), which breaks the [pattern](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet#:~:text=In%20both%20standard%20and%20extended%20thinking%20modes%2C%20Claude%203.7%20Sonnet%20has%20the%20same%20price%20as%20its%20predecessors%3A%20%243%20per%20million%20input%20tokens%20and%20%2415%20per%20million%20output%20tokens%E2%80%94which%20includes%20thinking%20tokens.) in the [industry](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/#:~:text=It%20matches%20GPT%E2%80%914%20Turbo%20performance%20on%20text%20in%20English%20and%20code%2C%20with%20significant%20improvement%20on%20text%20in%20non%2DEnglish%20languages%2C%20while%20also%20being%20much%20faster%20and%2050%25%20cheaper%20in%20the%20API.) of new models costing the same as their old versions. It’s still considerably cheaper than [Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing#anthropic-api), however, which was widely considered the best coding model until Gemini 2.5 Pro came out.

[^2]: A token represents about four characters of code. The average line of code among three [popular](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) [open-source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core) [projects](https://github.com/outline/outline) contains just under 40 characters, and the average file is about 250 lines. So, 50,000 tokens is roughly 200,000 characters, 5,000 lines, or 20 files.

[^3]: To frame the original question a bit differently, which would be more productive: Gemini, or an engineer working with the developer tools that existed 30 years ago? We’ve spent a lot of time developing ergonomic hammers for people with two arms and five fingers, and now we’ve attached those hammers to a steam engine. Which, sure, that’s an obvious first step, but we’ll eventually make a bunch of hammers that are optimized for the engine.

[^4]: Functioning means performant, secure, and so on.

[^5]: Today, chain-of-thought models “think” in English: When they iteratively loop through some question, they answer it in English, and then use that output to prompt themselves again. Some people are worried about AI models thinking in “[neuralese](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3W8HZe8mcyoo4qGkB/an-idea-for-avoiding-neuralese-architectures-1),” in which the outputs are written in some highly complex language (or, more likely, in mathematical structures) that contain much more information than English but are incomprehensible to humans. You could imagine agents writing code in some analogous way. Rather than writing Python or Typescript, which is highly optimized for human understanding, they could begin writing in denser languages that are optimized for them.

[^6]: To frame the original question differently again, which would be more productive: Gemini, or an engineer that had to write in assembly? When someone asks Claude Code to make an app, what they’re really asking—or at least what Claude is implicitly trying to do—is to make an app using code that the person can easily understand. Which is also requiring the machine to work around our limitations rather than its own.

[^7]: At $250,000 each, 20 junior engineers would cost $5 million, so that’s more or less the floor.

[^8]: In my example, making one request every fifteen seconds costs about the same as hiring an engineer. If 1) inference costs fall by a factor of 1000 in five years, which is [slower than the current rate](https://a16z.com/llmflation-llm-inference-cost/), and 2) new techniques make prompting twice as efficient, which seems fairly conservative, people will be able to make 2,000 times more requests in 2030 than they can today. That 133 requests per second would cost the same as hiring one engineer, so 800 requests per second would cost the same as hiring six engineers, making the total cost of the operation equivalent to a ten-person engineering team.

[^9]: For example, [repeat yourself a lot more](https://benn.substack.com/p/copy-copy-revolution). Don’t reuse a component to make a button; make each button its own component. This way, if you—or really, an AI—makes a change to a button, you only have to validate that *that* button works.
