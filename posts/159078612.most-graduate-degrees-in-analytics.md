# Most graduate degrees in analytics are scams

*A true American hustle. Plus, more White Lotus Power Rankings.*

![American Hustle': Fact Check | TIME.com](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M2Ym!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1b1d193-3cec-4b94-ace0-a3ff9bbd8255_720x480.jpeg)

If data analysts had a mantra, it would be "it depends." Yes, you asked a simple question—how much revenue did we make this quarter? Do people like our new product? Was our [big strategic pivot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don%C4%8Di%C4%87%E2%80%93Anthony_Davis_trade) a good decision?—but I cannot give you a simple answer. Nothing is black and white; there is nuance, texture, gradient. Certainty is for brutes; absolutes are for drunks. The real world is probabilistic; Bayesian; [fundamentally uncertain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle). To ask an analyst about concepts such as "revenue" and "people" and "good" is to ask [Richard Feynman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn_8) about magnets: For us to explain that, we have to start with the big bang, and work forward from there. How much money do we have? Ha. You sweet summer child, we will think. "It depends," we will say.

This is an annoying and counterproductive tic, but in some rough theoretical sense, it's usually correct. The ledger really does have things on both sides. Most decisions don't have easy answers; if a decision is worth debating at all, it probably has legitimate pros and cons. Tradeoffs are annoying, but tradeoffs are often real.[^1]

But not always. Every once in a while, decisions are easy. They might *appear* hard—like they are driven by some complex calculus; that they need to be weighed, considered, measured twice, and [SWOT’ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfB0g_JDIds). But sometimes, they are not. Sometimes, the balance really does tilt one way, and the world really is that simple.[^2]

For the season, here is one such decision: Should you get a master’s degree in analytics?

No. The answer is no.

On the surface, these programs serve a valuable need.[^3] In the late 2000s, the corporate world got enchanted with the promise of big data, data science, and the predictive power of analytical [precogs](https://minorityreport.fandom.com/wiki/Precogs). Data science is “the sexiest job of the 21st century,” [said the ](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)*[Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)*, famously. The people who can do it are “unicorns” and “high priests,” [said the ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/academic-researchers-find-lucrative-work-as-big-data-scientists-1407543088)*[Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/academic-researchers-find-lucrative-work-as-big-data-scientists-1407543088)*. Big data will “transform how we live, work, and think,” said [university professors and editors at the ](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Data-Revolution-Transform-Think/dp/0544227751)*[Economist](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Data-Revolution-Transform-Think/dp/0544227751)*.

But all these grand predictions included the same caveat: There is not enough analytical talent to meet the explosive demand for data scientists. A [quant crunch](https://4906807.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/4906807/BGT-reports/The_Quant_Crunch.pdf) was coming, said IBM. [McKinsey issued](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/big-data-the-next-frontier-for-innovation) the same warning. That was the drumbeat, at the time: Data volumes [are doubling every two years](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-new-philosophers?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=For%20years%2C%20one%20of%20the%20mainstays%20was%20a%20chart%20showing%20how%20data%20volumes%20double%20every%20two%20years.); data science is sexy; there is a looming skill shortage. “Good with numbers? Fascinated by data? The sound you hear is opportunity knocking,” [said the ](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html)*[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html)*.

Reasonably, a bunch of colleges rushed to bridge the gap. In 2007, NC State launched the country’s first [master’s in analytics](https://analytics.ncsu.edu/?page_id=1799#). In 2013, NYU debuted the first [master’s in data science](https://cds.nyu.edu/); a year later, Berkeley rolled out the [first online one](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2024/uc-berkeley-named-1-online-masters-data-science#:~:text=MIDS%2C%20which%20officially,and%20unstructured%20data.). Not to be outdone, UVA created an [entire institute](https://story.datascience.virginia.edu/).

Now, dozens of schools offer similar master’s programs, MOOCs, minors, concentrations, and data-related certificates. [According to a 2021 study](https://www.iacis.org/iis/2021/2_iis_2021_322-333.pdf), over half of the world’s accredited business schools have business analytics or data science degrees; they accounted for 20 percent of these schools’ degree programs, and produced [tens of thousands](https://www.encoura.org/resources/wake-up-call/the-rise-of-data-science-and-data-analytics-programs/) of graduates. If you want to be educated in the lucrative art of data science, there are dozens of colleges ready to help.

Or, more specifically, there are dozens of colleges ready to take your money. Because that is the first thing that has to be said about these programs: They are products, created to turn a profit.

Master’s degrees of all kinds [have always been this way](https://slate.com/business/2021/07/masters-degrees-debt-loans-worth-it.html)—“unregulated cash cows” that universities use to “enroll students at an industrial scale.” Students want to put a fancy school on their resumes, and master’s programs give colleges a way to launder them that right, without sacrificing their academic brands:

> If you’re offering bachelor’s degrees, they all have to be four years long. … You have to publicly publish your acceptance rates, your average SAT scores, so to the extent that you’re selling selectivity, you actually have to back it up with data, whereas in the master’s degree market, you can call almost anything a master’s degree. Master’s degree programs do not have to publish their admission statistics, which creates, I think, an enormous temptation for institutions that have very attractive brand names, that are attractive in no insignificant part because their undergraduate programs are very selective, to open up the floodgates on the master’s side and pay no penalty in the market because people don’t know they’re doing it.

A lot of data science and analytics programs stretch this cynicism even further. One senior university administrator told me that their analytics degree was hastily thrown together in the mid-2010s, not because there was any expertise to teach it, but because there was money to be made by selling it. It was offered by the business school, as it is at most universities, and had next to no association with the math, statistics, or computer science departments. The curriculum, such as there was one, was mostly cobbled together from existing business school classes and technical buzzwords like data mining and natural language processing. It was not an academic program or even a professional degree, but a year-long job fair, full of guest lectures, networking events, and interview training. The program also explicitly targeted international students as recruits, because they were more easily exploited: The degree was sold to them as a gateway to the U.S. job market, and, more cynically, as a way to get a visa.

The degree’s final “capstone project,” which is a [ubiquitous](https://professional-education-gl.mit.edu/mit-applied-data-science-course) feature of these [sorts of programs](https://www.analytics.gatech.edu/curriculum/msa-curriculum),[^4] was an accidental analogy for the entire industry: It has the appearance of practicality and prestige—you build a fraud model for Fidelity! A luggage fee dashboard [for Southwest](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/southwest-airlines-bag-policy-charge-basic-economy-9549218e)!—but it is in fact manufactured busywork. It is not an education or real-world experience; it is a line for a resume, a thing to talk about in a job interview, and a [gold card visa program](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/25/politics/us-gold-card-foreigners-trump/index.html), for [as “little” as $32,000](https://fortune.com/education/information-technology/most-affordable-masters-in-data-science/)—and as much as $129,000.[^5]

Of course, maybe that’s a good deal. Analytical jobs pay well, and most people attend these programs for the job opportunities anyway. The education is incidental, to both school and student.

Conveniently, the schools have done the math for you, and will tell you it’s worth it. The [University of San Diego says](https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/masters-data-analytics-worth-it/) advanced degrees will increase your salary by $15,000 to $25,000 a year; NC State says if you attend their program, [your salary will nearly double](https://analytics.ncsu.edu/?page_id=8975), and you’ll pay back your tuition and your lost earnings in under three years.

I mean, maybe; I’m sure there are success stories. But educators have a habit of [monkeying with these numbers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html), and things like NC State comparing the *median* salary of its incoming students to the *average* salary of its graduates are at least a little suspicious.[^6]

I can also say one thing more definitively: In Silicon Valley, these degrees are often disregarded. Most startups care about academic diplomas as a signaling mechanism—they like that you *got into* MIT and Stanford more than like that you were educated at MIT and Stanford.[^7] They aren’t looking for someone who went to classes for four years; they are trying to figure out[ your IQ](https://x.com/DOGE/status/1857076831104434289).

At best, pay-to-play master’s programs are ignored, and the degrees they offer are looked at as undifferentiated [paper credentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v38lu0Bi0Kk). At worst, they’re viewed as a red flag, the dark mark of someone who proudly fell for a scam.[^8]

Even for less judgmental employers, master’s programs can frequently be seen as lessons that need to be unlearned. Most analytical jobs [are messy](https://benn.substack.com/p/analytics-is-a-mess): They are figuring out how to translate vague questions about things you can’t directly measure into simple math about things that you can measure. They are finding clever proxies for unanswerable questions, and useful facts in the incomprehensible noise of test accounts and [mislabeled UTM parameters](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-design-flaw-at-the-heart-of-every#:~:text=The%20marketing%20funnel,29_len_p%2528fb%2529_gM_.%E2%80%9D). They are [politics](https://wrongbutuseful.substack.com/p/elbows-of-data). They are trying to read the vibes of a scatterplot of 15 customers, and [squinting at wiggles](https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-first-principles/).

A lot of master’s programs implicitly frame the job differently. They teach people how to do hard math on easy data. They teach the academic principles of data visualization. They teach toy problems, stripped of their authentic context.

None of which is *necessarily* bad; better to know the academic foundations than not. But those foundations are not the job, and a lot of startups are reluctant to hire people who think that it might be. And it is a little bit weird to get a degree that will, first and foremost, prompt a lot of employers to ask how much of that degree you’re able to forget.

So what do you do instead? I mean. First, ask someone else, who’s better at [getting](https://benn.substack.com/p/ambition-then-and-now?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=After%20a%20six%2Dmonth%20job%20search%2C%20I%20landed%20my%20first%20offer%20on%20my%20fifty%2Dninth%20application%3A) and [keeping](https://benn.substack.com/p/ambition-then-and-now?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=We%20both%20got%20fired%20from%20our%20startups.) a job than I am.[^9] And second, *do the capstone project yourself*. Find something you’re interested in and a question you want to answer, and answer it.

A big part of the problem with capstone projects is that they’re contrived. They are sandboxes on sample data. The subject is “real,” in that they’re case studies about actual businesses, but the analytical work is not. It is a prolonged interview question that the host company probably plans on throwing away. And it’s better to answer a genuine question about anything—[movies](https://www.statsignificant.com/), politics, the [emotional proclivities](https://benn.substack.com/p/should-we-be-nice-to-chatgpt) of Skynet, whatever is fun, to you—for several reasons:

You always wonder what’s down the other path. What if you went to this school instead of that one? Moved here instead of there? Joined that [one company](https://www.businessinsider.com/15-people-missing-out-on-millions-2014-3), [stayed instead of went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3zqJs7JUCQ), said [yes instead of not now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciWO-DEoA5M)? The road less traveled is tempting; the road untraveled is haunting. What life might we have, down that road?

But sometimes, the path doubles back. You catch a glimpse of it from the one you’re on, and see where you would’ve ended up. 

Back when I was looking for my first tech job, I applied to a few graduate programs that were precursors to today’s analytical master’s degrees. A few years later, I ran into several people who attended those programs at the same time I would’ve. We were all doing the same things: In one case, we were peers on the same team; in another, we had essentially identical jobs at parallel companies. 

And that, I think, is the nicest thing I can say about most of these master’s programs: That, in the end, they do nothing at all.[^11]

[^1]: Of course, most people aren’t asking for the answer in a rough theoretical sense. When we get asked, “What will happen if I trade Luka Dončić for a 32-year-old center [made of balsa wood](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/anthony-davis-player-injuries)?,” the correct answer is not, “In a rough theoretical sense, it depends.” The correct answer is, “[You will get crucified.](https://www.fox4news.com/sports/mavs-fans-chant-fire-nico-during-medieval-times-dinner)”

[^2]: Ibid.

[^3]: In, you know, a rough theoretical sense.

[^4]: Fifteen of the 35 programs [profiled by Fortune](https://fortune.com/education/information-technology/most-affordable-masters-in-data-science/) mention “capstone” projects.

[^5]: In fairness, these programs do offer one genuine benefit: If you are into college sports, and your alma mater [is a perpetual disappointment](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap/_/gameId/401743771), getting a master’s is a socially acceptable way to buy your way into a new fanbase.

[^6]: Probably an honest mistake; it’s not a degree about data or anything.

[^7]: This is rough, and there are obviously exceptions, especially in highly-technical research jobs. But for the general startup population—for analysts, engineers, marketers, and so on—this broadly holds.

[^8]: Also, if you have one of these degrees, that’s fine! The schools are the scammers here, not the students. What’s important, I think, is to be aware of how the degree is perceived.

[^9]: No, really, ask other people. Tech jobs are extraordinarily nepotistic. The good news is that it’s light nepotism: People don't hire their cousins as much as they hire people that their friends introduced them to. Cold outreach to people can be surprisingly effective, so long as the emails are genuine, and ask real, material questions. People love feeling helpful. They do not love coming up with ways to be helpful.

[^10]: This is part of makes a lot of these programs so contemptible. For some international students, master’s degrees like these really are a useful entry into the United States, at a time when those are getting [increasingly rare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_policy_of_the_second_Donald_Trump_administration). But because the programs are often abused by the colleges that provide them, all their students are tarred with the same stigma, even the promising ones.

[^11]: I get that this is terrible analysis, and that I’m taking all sorts of artistic license to make this point in this way. This is what happens when you don’t get a real analytical education.
