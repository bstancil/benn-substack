*Software, so hot right now.*

Why does [everyone hate Jira](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/)?

There are lots of answers. Because the [interface is clunky and slow](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/17/) and makes people angry. Because they need to watch a few hours of tutorials to be [able to understand this piece of crap.](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/16/) Because it’s [nothing more than a collection of hacks](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/13/). Because it’s full of [mountains of feature bloat](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/55/) that get in the way. Because it requires [a 747 cockpit worth of buttons and links](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/43/) just to do something that should take two seconds. Because it is a [blight on humanity](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/36/).

Ok, but why do people *use *Jira? They would rather [use Trello](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/5/). They would rather [use a text editor](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/24/). They would rather [stab themselves in the eyes](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/2/). They would rather [peel off their own skin and bathe their weeping raw flesh in a bath of vinegar](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/45/).

Alas. They still use Jira, because these people—the people who hate Jira—aren’t the people who *buy* Jira. [Management](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/25/), who [doesn’t have to actually resolve tickets in Jira](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/26/), buys it, forces [everyone else to adopt it](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/52/), and [nobody can use anything else](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/12/). If you have to use Jira, you hate it. If you don’t have to use Jira, you buy it.

For decades, this was the paradox of enterprise software: The buyers and users were often different people. IT departments bought software for everyone else, and the things that IT wants—options to customize and control how software gets used, long lists of security certifications, features that check the boxes on their [RFPs](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/request-proposal-rfp), to be invited to [fancy dinners](https://benn.substack.com/p/all-at-one-time?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=The%20events%20themselves%20also%20all%20rhyme.) at Gartner conferences—are not the things that people who regularly use Jira want. So Jira, like nearly every other enterprise software product of its generation, wasn’t built just for its users; it was also built for its buyers. And as long as those buyers are happy, it doesn’t matter if people who use Jira hate it, if they want to [claw their eyes out](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/22/) when they open it, if it makes them [pull out their hair](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/3/), or if it makes [their souls die](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/28/). Because they are [trapped in the belly of the horrible machine](https://genius.com/3353329), and even if the machine is bleeding to death, it will not let them out.

But about fifteen years ago, the trend reversed. Startups began marketing their products directly to Jira’s [condemned](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/53/) users. Jira is bad for you, they said. It’s what makes you hate your job. Its loading spinner isn’t just a five-second delay; it is a corporate Pavlovian trigger. It is your miserable Monday morning. It is your incompetent boss. It is your office’s humming fluorescent lights, the chemical stink of Melissa’s cheap perfume, the whine of Alex’s dumb laugh, the nauseating air in the third floor kitchen. Don’t buy Jira, which was made for [Gilbert Huph](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Gilbert_Huph), and ruins your incredible potential. Buy [Asana](https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/23/workplace-collaboration-tool-asana-raises-28m-at-a-280m-valuation/), which was made for *you*:

> “I know enterprise isn’t usually your beat,” [Asana founder Justin] Rosenstein remarked when I mentioned that I had heard about and was interested in Asana’s popularity, “But I’m guessing that’s related to the fact that most enterprise services are just bad products, they’re made to appease the CIO instead of the end-user… I’d like to think one of the biggest things we’re doing differently is that we come from a deep product user-experience-above-all-else background.”

For companies like Asana, the pitch was product delight, and the sales motion was subversion—or, in some cases, light blackmail. These startups[^1] encouraged people to [sign up on their own](https://asana.com/create-account), without asking IT for permission first. Then, once people started to build habits around it, Asana’s sales team would call up the IT department, and make them an [offer they couldn’t refuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6me2-OurCw&t=52s). Asana, and *its* generation of enterprise software, didn’t want to force people to use bad software by selling to IT; they sold good software to people, and forced IT to buy it.

The whole thing had a name: [The consumerization of IT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerization_of_information_technology).[^2] Consumer technology products like Snapchat and Netflix and Apple AirPods are typically bought by the people who use them, so apps that are slow, confusing, or missing important features won’t get bought. The better product wins, not the one with the best sales mechanics or the longest list of compliance policies.[^3]

There was something healthy about this, and something final. Products being bought and sold by backroom negotiation is a form of market failure. Products being chosen on their own merits is pure and efficient. It is the invisible hand exerting its will; it is the market reaching its unavoidable equilibrium. 

Or so it seems.

# Fame and fortune

Last week, I [mentioned an old survey](https://benn.substack.com/i/153688100/vc-fantasy-league) I ran in which I asked people which type of founder they would invest in, between an industry veteran, a ruthless operator, a talented prodigy, someone who is decisive and fast, or a data expert. Though experience and analytical expertise won, I may have left out the best option: A celebrity.

Because, in a world of social media, copycat trends, and flattened global fame, this is how we buy stuff now. We used to buy roughly commoditized products—clothes, home goods, food, liquor, whatever—based on long-built reputations of product quality and reliability; then, we bought them because brands hired celebrities to pitch us their products in TV commercials; and now, we buy them because influencers *make* them. Emma Chamberlain doesn’t promote Warby Parker glasses; [she designs them](https://www.warbyparker.com/emma-chamberlain-2024). We buy [Kylie’s cosmetics](https://kyliecosmetics.com/), Mr. Beast’s [chocolate bars](https://feastables.com/collections/mrbeast-bars), Logan Paul’s [energy drinks](https://drinkprime.com/), Rihanna’s [beauty products](https://fentybeauty.com/), 63 different celebrities’ [tequilas and bourbons and gins](https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/g22118748/best-celebrity-liquors/), and Gwenth Paltrow’s [goop](https://goop.com/). Though quality still matters—[Dave Portnoy found the floor](https://www.instagram.com/p/DC64ctlpRm0/)—it’s hardly the only thing that matters, and probably not even the most important thing.[^4] What matters is winning a global popularity contest. 

Nothing illustrates this better than the Stanley car fire. About a year ago, a woman’s car caught on fire. She posted a TikTok of her pulling a charred Stanley tumbler out of its melted skeleton—because every emergency is an opportunity for some good content, I guess—[and shook it](https://www.tiktok.com/@danimarielettering/video/7301724587488759070). “There was fire yesterday,” she said, “and it still has ice in it.”[^5] The video went viral, Stanley saw it, and offered to replace her car [in a response video](https://tiktok.com/@stanleybrand/video/7302186682831392043). She got a car, Stanley won some [marketing awards](https://shortyawards.com/16th/the-car-that-set-stanley-on-fire), and people bought [750 million dollars worth](https://www.vox.com/culture/24031385/stanley-craze-tumbler-best-water-bottle) of Stanley cups.[^6]

Ostensibly, the original video showed how good Stanley’s tumblers are—and how, according to their response video, they are “built for life.” But that’s obviously not why people bought them. They bought them because Stanleys were cool, because surviving a fire was cool, and because giving a woman a car was cool. Nobody wants their Stanley for life. They want to [buy 15 of them, and use them all once](https://www.tiktok.com/@courtneyannklang/video/7403846233430986030). They want their Stanley for a season, and then they want it to biodegrade into [a 20-year-old digital camera](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/07/technology/digital-cameras-olympus-canon.html).

Of course, none of this is entirely new—trends have existed forever.[^7] But that’s the point. This is the natural evolution of how categories of things are bought and sold. First, by salesmen; then, by product reputation; and finally, by fashion and fad.

And why would software markets be different? If IT was consumerized, why wouldn’t it get memeified next?

# Fad not function

In some ways, it’s already happening. Silicon Valley has already rotated past product quality alone, and [is entering an era](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/taste-is-eating-silicon-valley) of “taste:”

> In a world of scarcity, we treasure tools. In a world of abundance, we treasure taste. The barriers to entry are low, competition is fierce, and so much of the focus has shifted — from tech to distribution, and now, to something else too: taste.
> Taste is eating software. Taste is the new weapon.
> Whether expressed via product design, brand, or user experience, taste now defines how a product is perceived and felt as well as how it is adopted, i.e. distributed — whether it’s software or hardware or both.

Fair, though taste seems like too substantive of a term. There’s a nobility to it; it has echoes of craft and quality; it is suggestive of the opinions of the discerning.

I’m more cynical. We do not like things from first principles. We like them because other people like them. Our [desires are memetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimetic_theory); our social proof is gossip; our interests are compelled. Is ChatGPT [the leading enterprise chatbot](https://www.tanayj.com/p/openai-and-anthropic-revenue-breakdown) because it’s the best product, because it has the most agreeable aesthetic, or because it’s the trendy chatbot? Or, more pointedly, if you were funding an OpenAI competitor, who would you bet on to dethrone them? A marginally better model, or a celebrity?

The market seems to prefer the latter. Bret Taylor’s AI startup Sierra was [valued at a billion dollars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-26/bret-taylor-s-ai-startup-to-get-funding-at-near-1-billion-value?srnd=technology-ai&embedded-checkout=true) within a year of its founding, and [4.5 billion dollars](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-chairs-ai-startup-sierra-gets-45-bln-valuation-latest-funding-round-2024-10-28/) nine months later. OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever *raised *[a billion dollars](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-co-founder-sutskevers-new-safety-focused-ai-startup-ssi-raises-1-billion-2024-09-04/) for Safe Superintelligence before his company had a dozen employees and before its website [used JavaScript](https://ssi.inc/). And Elon Musk [raised 12 billion dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/25/elon-musks-xai-lands-billions-in-new-cash-to-fuel-ai-ambitions/) for his AI hobby, because he’s the President of the United States.

The whiplash between AI coding assistants has followed a similar pattern. GitHub’s Copilot was the original leader. Then Devin [engineered a viral launch](https://x.com/cognition_labs/status/1767548763134964000) that made them the model of the moment—until they were upended by [Cursor, so hot right now, Cursor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV_hDyfmEw4).

Conceivably, this hot potato-ing of attention is a reflection of the dynamic AI market in which these products are operating. Demand is vertical; technology is changing; with every new state-of-the-art release, a new leader rockets to the top.

Perhaps. But that seems like an overly wholesome explanation. Engineers are just as susceptible to social pressures and [popularity contests](https://www.producthunt.com/) as teenagers on Twitch. Nobody gets fired for buying IBM, nobody gets made fun of for [wearing a JanSport](https://nymag.com/strategist/2023/09/best-high-school-backpacks-beacon-school-nyc.html#:~:text=Black%20JanSports%20ruled%20the%20hallways), and those two things are related. Because, for as much as Silicon Valley [celebrates the builders](https://paulgraham.com/good.html), our [economy is content](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/but-this-is-tremendous-content) and our opinions come from [others' upvotes](https://news.ycombinator.com/). And in that [collapsed context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse), attention is [all you need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need).

# FTP over Feastables

Mr. Beast’s chocolate bars are called Feastables. As far as I can tell, that pun is the only reason Mr. Beast chose to make chocolate bars instead of sandals, or soda, or collectable figurines. He was famous, he needed something to sell, chocolate bars are all kind of the same, and feast rhymes with beast. So he sold chocolate.

What else is all kind of the same? To-do apps. Email clients. Enterprise applicant tracking systems. ([BI tools.](https://benn.substack.com/p/everything-is-still-bi)) Someone releases a new one on Product Hunt every week, attempts to astroturf some buzz, and then [slogs away on LinkedIn](https://benn.substack.com/p/ed-harris-would-like-to-connect-with?utm_source=publication-search) for a decade, trying to get anyone to pay attention to them.

So…if you’re a celebrity, why not start a software company? Steph Curry has [58 million followers on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stephencurry30/). How is some 25-year-old PM from Ramp supposed to compete with that? Who would you rather work for, the greatest shooter in basketball history, or Jeff? Whose brand would you rather create, the one that weaves together stories about parties with LeBron James and [Kendrick Lamar lyrics](https://genius.com/31634215), or the one that was inspired by Jeff’s frustrations from managing a remote team? Whose email provider would you rather use, yet another Superhuman close—dark mode! Keyboard shortcuts! AI summaries!—or the one that half the NBA uses?

[Media companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpringHill_Company) are dying. [Restaurants](https://www.elways.com/) are low-margin. Don’t just invest in tech companies, Steph. Make a ChefTP, the leading FTP server for Silicon Valley, and claim you rightful place as the true king of San Francisco.

[^1]: Which included [Yammer](https://benn.substack.com/p/welcome-to-bennventures#:~:text=Yammer%2C%20the%20first%20tech%20company%20I%20worked%20for%2C%20built%20one%20of%20the%20early%20products%20that%20tried%20to%20replace%20email%20with%20a%20SaaS%20app.), where I worked for 18 months.

[^2]: From that [2012 TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/23/workplace-collaboration-tool-asana-raises-28m-at-a-280m-valuation/) about Asana: “One might say that Asana is the poster-child for the consumerization of the IT industry.”

[^3]: Although, there is the occasional enterprisification of consumer products, in which people buy stuff because it’s bundled together with other services. A lot of people probably bought Apple Music because Apple gave them a [free subscription](https://offers.applemusic.apple/new-device-offer) with their iPhone. This can be tricky though: Bundle too many consumer products, and you’ll probably [get sued](https://www.wsj.com/tech/google-should-be-forced-to-sell-chrome-browser-justice-department-says-13602df9).

[^4]: Case in point: Dupes and knockoffs are sometimes [more popular](https://www.thecut.com/2023/06/nike-sweatshirts-dupe.html) than the real thing.

[^5]: I mean, that is impressive.

[^6]: This was in 2023, and the fire was towards the end of 2023, so it’s not clear how much the fire contributed to that number. But searches for “[stanley for sale](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=stanley%20for%20sale&hl=en)” hit a peak the week of the story, and Stanley [kept growing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/10/28/stanleys-111-year-reinvention-from-lunch-boxes-to-viral-must-have/) for another six to nine months after the fire. So it clearly helped.

[^7]: We can manufacture them much faster now though. You can be a nobody one week, make a viral TikTok the next, and [create a memecoin](https://newsletterhunt.com/emails/129123) to directly monetize your fame in the third. Influence and popularity are fundamentally the same, but they have all collapsed into a single hurricane of noise, and a single marketplace for attention.

![A leafy palm tree is visible amid power cables and clouds of smoke.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SBVB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c884fe-c313-4641-a599-3a45465e3cc9_600x450.jpeg)
*[Los Angeles.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/california-wildfire-photos.html)*

In 2011, [Hugo Chavez wanted his gold back](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-15900885). It was stored in vaults in London—$11 billion of it; 13,000 bars of it; 160 metrics tons of it; 350,000 pounds of it; a [blue whale](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/blue-whale) of it—and that made things complicated: If Hugo Chavez wanted to use the gold to buy cars, or food, or [fun Chavismo jackets](https://www.paragonjackets.com/product/chavez-venezuela-jacket/) for his loyal Chavistas, he had to call a bank and say, “please send my gold to the BMW store, or the grocery store, or to [Oak Business Center](https://www.paragonjackets.com/contact/) in Brea, California,” and the bank could say no. The people of Venezuela owned the gold, Hugo Chavez controlled the gold, but London *had* the gold. For Hugo Chavez—a controversial authoritarian with a [distaste for democracy](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2003/03/hugo-chavez-and-the-limits-of-democracy) and a tempting target for economic sanctions—that was no good.

But he had a problem. Hugo Chavez wanted to put his gold in Caracas, in Venezuela, and Caracas is [4,600 miles](https://www.airmilescalculator.com/distance/ccs-to-lhr/) from London, with [a lot of ocean in between](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/London,+United+Kingdom/Caracas,+Capital+District,+Venezuela/@30.370983,-58.2905591,3.99z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x47d8a00baf21de75:0x52963a5addd52a99!2m2!1d-0.1275862!2d51.5072178!1m5!1m1!1s0x8c2a58adcd824807:0x93dd2eae0a998483!2m2!1d-66.9036063!2d10.4805937!3e4?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEwNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). It is not easy to move an $11 billion mountain of precious metal 4,600 miles. You have to unload it from its vaults, and load it into trucks, and those trucks [will ride low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLCmDCMTq4A&t=132s). You have to unload the trucks onto planes and boats, but planes cannot fly that far with that much cargo—Boeing’s [most capable and fuel efficient](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/freighters) freighters can only carry about 100 tons; Airbus’ [dopey beluga whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_Beluga) can only fly 1,700 miles—and the [ocean is dangerous](https://www.tiktok.com/@at_sea_/video/7429797693251161377). You have to land the planes and dock the boats and load and unload more trucks, and you have to trust everyone who does it. You have to have guards, and you have to [trust the guards too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWDqXbtymgg).

It is easy to forget all this. Most of our money is not a pile of rocks in a vault, but a number on a spreadsheet, with a name next to it. It does not exist in London because it does not exist at all. It is in our phones, [in a computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2uHBhKTSe0), in the cloud. We cannot Venmo $11 billion to our friends because there isn’t $11 billion dollars next to our name in the spreadsheet, and because Venmo’s [terms of service](https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/209690048-Personal-Profile-Bank-Transfer-Limits) say that we can’t. We can’t do it because software engineers didn’t build in the affordance.

They could, though. If Hugo Chavez wanted to Venmo himself $11 billion of dollars—digital dollars, bank account dollars, database dollars—it could be done with a few lines of code. Make a ticket; move some bits; update the spreadsheet. The only laws are the sharp edge of physics—the [speed of light](https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/08/are-processors-pushing-up-against-the-limits-of-physics/), the [size of atoms](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/306358/20240704/physicists-now-perfecting-semiconductors-down-single-atom.htm), the amount of [palladium](https://newagemetals.com/the-pivotal-role-of-palladium-in-advancing-ai-technologies/) in the earth. It is all on the computer, and on computers, [we can make whatever we want](https://benn.substack.com/p/getting-away-with-it#:~:text=It%20was%20a%20computer%2C%20he%20said%3B%20we%20can%20make%20whatever%20we%20want.%C2%A0).

A friend once told me that Meta’s Oculus engineers are not allowed to wear the headsets for more than a few hours at a time. If they do, she said, they dissociate from the physical universe. They grow so accustomed to their digital hands that their real bodies start to feel like detached avatars. When you live in the Matrix, the antiquated gravity of the analog world makes you nauseous.

We are not so different, perhaps. A decade of efforts to [addict us to our apps and devices](https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/0241184835/ref=asc_df_0241184835?mcid=2df5f11da55b38e9817a37055990794d&hvocijid=14537771719461859625-0241184835-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14537771719461859625&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1014221&hvtargid=pla-2281435180498&psc=1) made us addicted to our apps and devices, and we are more [metaverse now than man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNCxbM50eWQ). Twenty-year-olds now spend nearly ten hours a day [peering into a screen](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/607724b2ae76e535db9552ff/665e3221ce1495cf2ebcf44c_State%20of%20the%20Youth%E2%80%94Report%20on%20Raising%20a%20Connected%20Generation.pdf). We [live alone](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/?gift=o6MjJQpusU9ebnFuymVdsHLEgrw7xaVlFdZ_ahquf0Y&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share), texting, posting, commenting, watching, consuming. Our friends are digitized; our [friends are bots](https://wired.me/technology/character-ai-obsession/); we aren’t sure [which is which](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/03/the-chatgpt-secret-is-that-text-message-from-your-friend-your-lover-or-a-robot). Things we don’t like can be swiped away; things that we do can be delivered to our door.

If there’s an [app for everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szrsfeyLzyg), we forget that we live in a world of high seas and deep oceans; of long journeys; of rocks that are hard to move. Instead, the things that happen to us feel like they happen because someone designed the system that way. Inconveniences are bugs, bad product experiences, or the [selfish choices of evil men](https://x.com/jules_su/status/1818432149827072022). The [burrito we ordered](https://x.com/sabrmattrics/status/1818286314795811060) was not a farm and farmer in Nebraska; an actual cow; a network of trucks and warehouses; a kitchen; a chef; an immigrant with a family driving a scooter through the rain, wondering where [they might find the next bathroom](https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/12/16/doordash-nyc-bathroom-access-skeptical-workers/). They are manifest, apparated, conjured into existence by a few clicks and the invisible shuffling inside of a bank’s spreadsheet.

When we are so accustomed to the tailored impermanence of internet life—feeds can be curated, text messages can be edited, broken phones can be replaced, bugs fixed, refunds issued—reality becomes unsettling. But we are all jarred back into it, sometimes. That moment when your plane bounces a little too much. When a man follows a little too close. When your gold is stuck in London. When your friend falls sick, unsolvably sick, and you are reminded that the electricity that animates them, however divine its origins, is at the mercy of our humble need for a beating heart. There is no app for that.

It is awful, what is happening in Los Angeles. Though the human tragedy is, so far, [small](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/09/us/california-fires-los-angeles)—the war in Ukraine has hollowed out [an entire generation](https://www.wsj.com/world/one-million-are-now-dead-or-injured-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-b09d04e5); in Gaza, [unknown thousands are dead](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02678-3/fulltext); just two days ago, more than a [hundred people died](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/06/china/china-tibet-earthquake-intl-hnk/index.html) in an earthquake in Nepal—the [images](https://www.npr.org/sections/the-picture-show/2025/01/09/g-s1-41784/los-angeles-fire-photos) are [nuclear](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/california-wildfire-photos.html).

We could’ve prevented it, maybe, by being better stewards of our planet. But once the fires were lit, they could not be put out; once the neighborhoods were gone, it couldn’t be undone. We could not swipe them away, revert their devastation, or buy them off.

The [newspaper graphics](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/08/weather/los-angeles-fire-maps-california.html) of southern California look like maps of troop movements in history textbooks. The fire is surrounding Los Angeles, squeezing in, executing the pincer maneuver of a Panzer brigade. But this was a war between the most primordial technologies and elemental weapons: Fire and wind versus water and earth. Ash versus air. Life versus death. The fire cannot be programmed. The Santa Anas cannot be bought. There is no app for that either.

Should days like these make us grateful to be living at this [privileged edge of history](https://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272929/global-poverty-health-crime-literacy-good-news), in which we’ve tamed so many of the world’s tragedies? Should we accelerate, geoengineer the climate, and move to Mars? Should we cocoon ourselves in our designer worlds, and put all of our remaining inconveniences on Silicon Valley’s collective backlog? Should we touch more grass? Should we call our parents?

No matter. The machine will roll on. The internet is in perpetual motion now; our [howling vortex](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-internet-2022) cannot be turned off.

I am in San Francisco this week, and in San Francisco, [the cars drive themselves](https://waymo.com/blog/2024/06/waymo-one-is-now-open-to-everyone-in-san-francisco). I rode one for the first time recently. A few minutes after hailing it from my phone, a Jaguar gracefully pulled up next to me. It was unnerving at first—and then, quickly, delightful. The discomforts of city travel had been slicked away by a [luxury motorcar](https://www.instagram.com/snlreelz/reel/C9OxxCEOqCU/?hl=en) topped with whirling fez and an incomprehensible set of autonomous calculations.

Two days ago, I saw another Waymo. It was double parked. On its right side, the person that it had blocked in was trying to get out. On its left, a city bus—[tethered to cables suspended above the road](https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/muni/munis-electric-trolley-buses), bound to its path like a train hanging from overhead tracks—was trying to inch past. The two manned cars had pinched the robot in, and it did not know what to do.

I stood watching for a minute, curious how everyone would dislodge themselves. A crush of impatient traffic was building behind them. The car was honking, the bus driver was getting frustrated, and the Waymo sat frozen. How uncomfortable, I thought, to be that passenger, helplessly sitting in their broken escape pod, with the real world suddenly bearing down on them. Our technological armor is thick and getting thicker, but [life finds a way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oijEsqT2QKQ). 

I wondered if there would be more collisions like this—between Jaguars and city buses, between digital runaways and those who cannot afford to be, between our expectations for instant abundance, and unyielding distances and inextinguishable fires. The more we bend our world to our will, the more loaded its bow. The more we curate our lives, the weaker our immunity to its intruders.

I do not know how long it took for the traffic to disperse. By the time I walked away, I had put my headphones on and blotted out the horns.

*[advantages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A9wpMpgENE)*

Here's a thing I hadn't thought about before:

If you are the vice president of customer experience at a large airline, you are probably worried about your job. You were hired to affordably provide great customer service to millions of people, and for years, you built a sprawling array of infrastructure to do it. You hired thousands of [passenger assistance representatives and reservations agents](https://jobs.aa.com/go/Customer-Service/2537000/); you created an assortment of ticketing applications in [Microsoft Azure](https://jobs.aa.com/job/DeveloperSr-Developer%2C-IT-Applications/76954-en_US); you recruited a team of engineers to build them in Java and Angular. But, because you believe in [continuous innovation](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberly-cisek-b70a5a5/), you’ve been following what’s been happening in Silicon Valley. It is the [Age of AI](https://a16z.com/the-future-of-learning-education-knowledge-in-the-age-of-ai/); of [intelligence](https://ia.samaltman.com/); of [agents](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jensen-huang-declares-age-agentic-154517698.html). The [building blocks](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-in-2025/) are in place, and it is the dawn of a new era. Though [AI will save the world](https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/), it might get you, a customer support leader overseeing a worldwide network of call centers, fired.

And so, you are marshalling all the money you can to investigate this new future. “It’s critical for us to be at the forefront of this transformational wave,” you say when you get back from the [Airport Customer Experience Summit](https://aci.aero/events/customer-experience-summit-and-exhibition/) in Atlanta. “Airlines that adopt generative AI technologies will be able to provide better experiences to their customers, and more value to their shareholders. Airlines that don’t will have worse margins, lower earnings, and more frustrated customers. We cannot be Blockbuster; we must be Netflix.” People nod along, because [everyone agreed with you already](https://benn.substack.com/p/long-on-shovels-short-on-gold?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=But%20it%E2%80%99s%20still,spending%20in%20AI.). You secure a big budget. You go shopping. You buy lots of stuff.

[By all accounts](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/generative-ai-to-become-a-1-3-trillion-market-by-2032-research-finds/), there are thousands of stories like this. In the two years since ChatGPT came out, countless companies have urgently funded innovation budgets. They have created AI skunkworks teams and anointed chief AI officers. They’ve sent emissaries to Silicon Valley to come back with a plan. They have FOBO—Fear of Blockbustering Ourselves—and are ready to [spend every dollar](https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/2017-07-24/non-technology-companies-betting-big-on-artificial-intelligence) they can muster to not be a Harvard Business School case study for the class of 2040.

Though these sorts of things have happened before—there was the internet; there was mobile; there was, in its own little manic way, crypto and web3—this hype cycle seems to be different in two ways.

First—and obviously—it’s all happening at once. The internet and the cloud was a slower burn; the mobile revolution [had its doubters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qycUOENFIBs); web3 never went mainstream. There were early adopters, late adopters, and Blockbusters. This time around, everything is tighter. Aesthetically, the technological discontinuity is more severe; the pace of development is faster; the coverage is even more breathless; the skeptics are harder to find. There is no adoption curve anymore; there are only users, and the walking dead. And that seems to make the cycle spin faster: Spending creates a sense of momentum, which signals more confidence in AI’s inevitability, which makes everyone more afraid, which makes spending even more necessary.

But here’s the other thing—and this is the dynamic in all of this that seems much less obvious—if you are the vice president of customer experience at a large airline and you now have a big budget to spend on AI, *you don’t want to buy it from IBM*. The world isn’t being invented by “global innovation centers;” it’s not being invented in office parks where people take 90-minute lunches at Panera; it’s not being invented on PCs, with Excel, on Teams. It’s being invented by the kids.

The spreadsheet people are slow moving. They build product suites, and enterprise SKUs. They package technologies into industry solutions. They give pitches about the necessity of digital transformation, and also talk about shareholder value. Their slides are full of text, in PowerPoint, and have legal disclaimers on the bottom. They aren’t inventing AI, but “investigating it like an anthropologist, or an alien visiting Earth.”[^1]

The kids aren’t investigating. They aren’t bemused. They are hacking, building—without budgets, without spreadsheets, with reckless abandon. The regulators’ whistles don’t stop them; the looming giants don’t deter them; they are [accelerating anyway](https://x.com/NBA/status/1879730349003120797), bulleting down the lane, [with no regard for human life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tag9UmmFfY8). They don’t have slides; they have demos. Their offices are full of vertical monitors covered in code. They are crazy, to the vice president of customer experience at a large airline, but the [crazy ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtftHaK9tYY) are who will change the world. If you’re afraid of the future, you want to find the people who are building it, not the people who are hosting webinars about their new Modern Intelligence™ offering, now in private preview.

In other words, not only is there no incumbency advantage; if anything, being a large, mature vendor is *bad*. Normally, Oracle can walk into the office of a major airline, and win on, roughly, vibes: “We understand your enterprise needs; we have the security teams that will make your CIO comfortable; we will hold your hand through this important partnership; our roster of customers includes every other major airline. You are safe with us.” With AI products, the vibes are at least partially inverted. The best vendor is the one that walks in with a futuristic demo, a pile of cash from premier venture capitalists, and the wild eyes of an unhinged visionary.[^2]

Together, these two dynamics seem to be breaking the usual laws of startup growth. Glean, a work automation platform, is making [$40 million a year](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/glean-is-worth-2point2-billion-as-citigroup-databricks-workday-invest.html) less than four years after its founding. Harvey, an AI lawyer, is [making $50 million](https://x.com/pitdesi/status/1880022913115648153) after only three years. The monthly revenue for Cursor, an AI-coding assistant, went from [making $350,000 to $4 million in six months](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/in-just-4-months-ai-coding-assistant-cursor-raised-another-100m-at-a-2-5b-valuation-led-by-thrive-sources-say/). Eleven Labs, an generative audio company founded in 2022, is [making $80 million a year](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/03/investors-are-scrambling-to-get-into-elevenlabs-which-may-soon-be-valued-at-3-billion/); 11x, a startup building digital workers (and a different company than Eleven Labs), [launched in late 2023](https://www.11x.ai/blog/11x-fundraise) and is already approaching [$10 million in annual revenue](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/30/11x-ai-a-developer-of-ai-sales-reps-has-raised-50m-series-b-led-by-a16z-sources-say/). Those [old parabolic curves](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/the-centaur-report#:~:text=We%20have%20been%20longtime%20champions%20of%20enduring%20cloud%20businesses%20that%20have%20carved%20unique%20paths%20to%20becoming%20a%20Centaur.%20Companies%20such%20as%20HashiCorp%2C%20Zapier%2C%20and%20Toast%20have%20all%20grown%20their%20revenue%20at%20unprecedented%20rates%20and%20continue%20to%20live%20on%20in%20the%20Centaur%20Hall%20of%20Fame.) of the fastest-growing SaaS companies reaching $100 million in revenue in five to seven years now look quaint. Today, the lines are straight up.

When people look at these numbers, they typically say, man, [what a great time to start a company](https://www.startuparchive.org/p/sam-altman-this-is-probably-the-best-time-maybe-ever-to-be-starting-your-career).[^3] And that may be true, in the sense that the world is turning upside down, and there’s lots of money that could eventually be made.

But the “eventually” part seems awfully important. Because in this context—in a market that’s cranking out hundreds of new startups a month, that’s funded by a trillion dollar corporate slush fund, in which the incumbents are cringe, and some companies are regularly going from zero to $60 million in a couple years—what is “traction?” Does a company that’s making $30 million dollars have a real grip on the market?

If you can found a business in 2023, and be making tens of millions of dollars by the end of 2024, someone else can too. Absent [some other durable moat](https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/science-behind-the-fiction-humans-as-batteries-as-in-the-matrix-probably-not-gonna-happen)—like network effects, superior production process, or unique access to a scarce resource, none of which many AI startups have—most software companies have only two ways to stay ahead of their competition: Brand, and the [long slog of putting in more effort](https://benn.substack.com/p/why-are-we-still-surprised-that-startups). But [young brands are fickle](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-trenderprise#:~:text=The%20whiplash%20between%20AI%20coding%20assistants%20has%20followed%20a%20similar%20pattern.%20GitHub%E2%80%99s%20Copilot%20was%20the%20original%20leader.%20Then%20Devin%20engineered%20a%20viral%20launch%20that%20made%20them%20the%20model%20of%20the%20moment%E2%80%94until%20they%20were%20upended%20by%20Cursor%2C%20so%20hot%20right%20now%2C%20Cursor.), and two years is not a long slog.

Though revenue typically *feels* like some sort of moat too, that’s mostly because companies historically haven’t been able to make that much money without one. A SaaS startup [becomes inevitable](https://www.saastr.com/from-initial-traction-to-initial-scale-10m-in-arr-dont-get-killed-by-your-success/) once it passes $10 million in annual revenue because you can’t make $10 million without refining a product, warding off legacy competitors, cultivating a sales channel, and trudging through years of messy effort. That was the old scale: $10 million is good progress, [$100 million is the ambition](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-winning-pitch-deck?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20other%20slides%20that%20people%20say%20you%20should%20put%20in%20your%20pitch%20deck%20is%20your%20path%20to%20%24100%20million%20in%20revenue.), and the less time it takes to get there, the better.

Does that still apply? At what point does the signal from fast growth invert, and no longer implies that a company is taking over some huge market, but instead implies that it found a huge vein of shallow gold in the ground, with no way to defend its mine? If you quietly dig a deep well behind a high wall and find a $100 million deposit of gold, you’re rich. If you stick a shovel in the ground in a crowded field and find a $100 million deposit of gold, you’ve got a problem. The former is a business; the second is a war.

Or, more explicitly, which company has a more promising future:

—

When [people](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2024/08/the-generative-ai-revolution-may-be-a-bubble/679345/) write [warnings](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/) about the [AI bubble](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2024/11/18/will-the-bubble-burst-for-ai-in-2025-or-will-it-start-to-deliver), they tend to fret about the broader ecosystem: The cost of data centers; Nvidia’s stock price; the [durability of big LLM providers](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-ai-companies-work) like OpenAI and Anthropic.[^4] They wonder if AI will live up to its world-changing promise, or if it will simply be an [empty burner](https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/climate-ai-tech-energy-demand-rising) that cooks an [already overheating world](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/11/climate/earth-warming-climate-tipping-points.html).

It seems like there’s another, more complex bubble building around the peripheral AI companies too. It’s not a bubble that misrepresents the fundamentals—there is real money in automating stuff; these are real companies solving real problems; they aren’t overhyped Ponzi schemes.

But they’re exposed. They’re out in the open. Though 1,000 vice presidents of customer experience throwing their wallets at startups change how quickly companies can grow, they don’t change how long it takes to build a recognizable brand or a rolodex of customer relationships. FOBO compresses the time it takes to make money, but it doesn’t compress the time it takes to build something durable. And a lot of today’s promising companies—and venture dollars—could disappear into that gap.

# Pinterest

It’s [always been](https://benn.substack.com/p/day-of-reckoning#footnote-4-83946516) one of the great mysteries of Silicon Valley to me. Facebook and Google became two of the most valuable companies in the world by building giant elaborate services that, in effect, indirectly tricked you into telling them what stuff you wanted to buy so that they could sell that information back to the people who wanted to sell it to you. Google parses thousands of your searchers, cleverly derives that you are a 27-year-old girl living in Dimes Square, and sells that conclusion to New Balance so that they can send you an ad for [their new “Snoafer.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/style/sneakers-new-balance-snoafers.html)

Of course, sometimes Google gets it wrong. Sometimes they think you’re a 27-year-old girl living in Dimes Square who would like the Snoafer, and you are; sometimes they think that, and you’re a man in Indiana who just watches a lot of *Outer Banks*, and you do not like the Snoafer.

Pinterest skips the middleman. There is no algorithm; there are no searches about “how to host a friendsgiving in a small apartment” that get probabilistically transformed into a likely Snoafer buyer. On Pinterest, you just tell it you want the Snoafer. That’s the whole thing: You look at stuff, and you pin the stuff you want to buy. It’s the quiet part of every consumer internet company said out loud. And [500 million people](https://business.pinterest.com/audience/) use it every month.

Given that Facebook and Google’s roundabout version of the same product has made them two of the most valuable companies on the planet, how is Pinterest not also huge? How is it not its own empire? How come we don’t talk about the FANGAP instead of the FAANGs?

But maybe I’ve got it backwards. [From Ryan Broderick’s ](https://www.garbageday.email/p/america-s-youth-longs-for-chinese-e-commerce)*[Garbage Day](https://www.garbageday.email/p/america-s-youth-longs-for-chinese-e-commerce)*[:](https://www.garbageday.email/p/america-s-youth-longs-for-chinese-e-commerce)

> Almost every major Chinese social app is built around “social shopping”. This is why they all emphasize trends over viral one-offs. They want you to buy a product and make content with it to inspire everyone else to make content with it. This is also why they hyper-target your interests so aggressively. But because Americans have no experience with these kind of apps, the impact of TikTok’s algorithm has been different here. Sure, there’s plenty of shopping — Stanley Cups are probably the best, most recent example of the TikTok e-commerce effect. But, as *WIRED* recently [point out](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-ban-my-chinese-spy-meme/?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=america-s-youth-longs-for-chinese-e-commerce), those systems have, perhaps inadvertently, been mainly used in the US to create genuinely supportive filter bubbles for young people, for different subcultures, strange fandoms, and all kinds of other communities. Something western companies like Meta have not ever been able to crack, possibly because, ironically enough, they aren’t nearly as focused on directly selling you shit, and much more interested in selling you to advertisers. And this irony is even more pronounced now that TikTokers are migrating to RedNote, which is, yes, like Pinterest or Instagram, but could more accurately be compared to QVC.

In the United States, we build social networks to collect data that we can sell to advertisers. According to Broderick, in China, people build apps to sell you stuff, *then *figure out who you are and the types of videos you might like based on that. And because the stuff you want to buy so precisely defines the types of communities you exist in,[^5] content curated by your shopping list is actually more engaging than content curated by some social graph. 

So maybe Pinterest is actually even more valuable than I thought—not as a smarter source of advertising data, but as the next new social network. Which works out, because [we might need one soon](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/13/china-tiktok-sale-elon-musk).

# Drudgery

People at tech companies often refer to their computers as their “machine.” There’s something mildly appropriative to it, as if we are operating a jackhammer or a plow. But the industrial connotation is, I think, intentional: It reminds us that we are humans, who are creative and thoughtful; the machine is our creativity, levered. [We are the management, and it is the labor](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1988/01/27).

I’ve wondered before if [AI undoes this relationship](https://benn.substack.com/p/we-dont-need-another-sql-chatbot):

> This pattern—computers automating more and more mechanical work; people doing more and more creative work—has become our default assumption about how technology advances, and for what we should do with new technology. …
> But this doesn’t have to continue forever. Technology could—again, in a very rough sense—go the other way. It could be more creative than reliable. It could subsume our lives from the top down, outperforming us in strategic tasks while struggling with the tactical ones. If this happens, the best things we could build with it might impose a choice: Do we use it to make us better at something, or do we use it to replace something we don’t want to do?

Tyler Cohen [sees the same inversion](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/the-future-of-the-scientist-in-a-world-with-advanced-ai.html) coming for academia:

> AI will know almost all of the academic literature, and will be better at modeling and solving most of the quantitative problems. It will be better at specifying the model and running through the actual statistical exercises. Humans likely will oversee these functions, but most of that will consist of nodding, or trying out some different prompts.
> The humans will gather the data.

Most predictions about AI are hyperbolic: It will destroy humanity, or it will usher an era of unprecedented prosperity. In twenty years, we will all be dead, or we will all be living lives of uninterrupted leisure. It will hunt us for sport and algorithmic pleasure, or it will do the repetitive and boring things we don’t like and “[free up human capacity for more meaningful work](https://investor.workday.com/2025-01-14-New-Global-Research-from-Workday-Reveals-AI-Will-Ignite-a-Human-Skills-Revolution).” We will either be carefree philosophers and creatives, or an [electrolyte goo](https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/science-behind-the-fiction-humans-as-batteries-as-in-the-matrix-probably-not-gonna-happen).

The truth may somehow be worse: Rather than turning us into batteries, the machines will make us [Jira admins](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-trenderprise#:~:text=Alas.%20They%20still,you%20buy%20it.).

# SDF

[Summer:](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/summit-season)

> Now, this low-friction workload portability doesn’t happen automatically just because you have an open file format, table format, and metastore. From what I can tell, in order to make this a reality, you need:

[December:](https://benn.substack.com/p/postgres-in-a-box)

> The ideal database would not only separate buckets [i.e., storage] and calculators [i.e., compute engines], but it would also separate the calculators from the programs that people want to run on them.
> Because, today, in order to use multiple calculators, you have to write programs in multiple languages. Every database engine has different APIs and uses a different variants of SQL, and all the queries and pipelines and applications built on that engine need to use that variant. You can’t simply point a query that was originally written for Databricks at a Snowflake or a DuckDB engine, because there are [very](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/datediff) stupid [differences](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/functions/datediff.html) between all [three](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/date.html#date_diffpart-startdate-enddate) of them. Even if the calculators are interoperable with the buckets, the programs are not interoperable with the calculators.
> So that seems like what’s next—[dbt directly on top of S3](https://benn.substack.com/p/what-happened-to-the-data-warehouse), more or less. You write queries in one language, like [dbt SQL](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/recovering-from-the-party#:~:text=dbt%E2%80%99s%20cross%2Dplatform%20capabilities%2C%20and%20its%20support%20for%20open%20table%20formats%2C%20is%20still%20in%20its%20early%20days.%20I%20fully%20expect%20this%20to%20a%20major%20area%20of%20innovation%20for%20us%20in%20the%20coming%20years%20as%20the%20entire%20ecosystem%20is%20reshaped%20around%20this%20new%20set%20of%20standards.) or [SDF SQL](https://blog.sdf.com/p/announcing-sdf-general-availability#:~:text=Ultimately%2C%20SDF%E2%80%99s%20vision%20is%20to%20enable%20execution%20of%20the%20same%20query%20against%20proprietary%20compute%20providers%20(like%20Snowflake%2C%20BigQuery%2C%20and%20Redshift)%20and%20SDF%20DB%3B%20with%20both%20query%20engines%20yielding%20the%20same%20result.), and it gets rewritten in whatever version of SQL a specific execution engine prefers. The programs and pipelines people write would then be agnostic to the calculators underneath them—which would then, as Tristan proposes, make it possible for people to choose the right engine for the right job.

Look, I appreciate the *New Yorker*, and would definitely work for the *New Yorker* (that font, it just looks [expensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mY5FNRh0h4&t=32s)*), but, what? It’s 2025! TikTok is eight years old! It’s hours from getting banned! The kids are [moving on](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/business/tiktok-rednote-xiaohongshu-app.html)! And the *New Yorker* sending [a child into the middle of the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4TiM_taMJY) to find out what’s going on? And the thing they find is that they’re “amused by the algorithm’s tailor-made content?” What are we doing here???* The cut from the Bieber quote straight to the Skrillex quote, just savage.

[^2]: Or, even better, you walk in with the swagger of a [Fortune 500 CEO](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/bret-taylor-has-been-promoted-to-salesforce-co-ceo/), the technological credentials of a [CTO](https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/bret-taylor-named-new-facebook-cto/), the network of a [professional board member](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/19/openai-bret-taylor-nonprofit-restructuring), the money of a [billionaire](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/bret-taylors-customer-service-ai-startup-just-raised-175m/), and the [entrepreneurial track record](https://www.businessinsider.com/quip-ceo-bret-taylor-750-million-salesforce-acquisition-2016-8) of someone who should be retired in the French Riviera. That person can probably close some deals too.

[^3]: Of course, in this case, the person saying it is the person who collects 20 percent of every one of these startups’ revenues.

[^4]: [TechCrunch recently reported](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/meta-execs-obsessed-over-beating-openais-gpt-4-internally-court-filings-reveal) that Facebook AI team’s wanted to better model than GPT-4:“Our goal needs to be GPT-4,” said Meta’s VP of Generative AI, Ahmad Al-Dahle, in an October 2023 message to Meta researcher Hugo Touvron. “We have 64k GPUs coming! We need to learn how to build frontier and win this race.”On one hand, whatever; this is just internal chatter about wanting to build something good; it is not, as TechCrunch put it, execs being obsessed with beating ChatGPT. On the other hand, this sort of clock speed comparison, in which major LLM providers are willing to spend more and more money to nudge ahead, is exactly [what makes them seem economically untenable](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-ai-companies-work). How long can you keep incinerating cash to make improvements that will probably be available for a fraction of the cost six to twelve months later? How much is being at the front of the peloton about being cool rather than [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloton#:~:text=The%20reduction%20in%20drag%20is%20dramatic%3B%20riding%20in%20the%20middle%20of%20a%20well%2Ddeveloped%20group%2C%20drag%20can%20be%20reduced%20by%20as%20much%20as%2095%25)?

A couple years ago, Founders Fund, a venture capital firm that was started by Peter Thiel, hosted a conference called [Hereticon](https://x.com/foundersfund/status/1555303358696677379). It was branded as a “conference for thoughtcrime," and featured a slate of talks that combined mildly edgy taboos—tattoos, [psychedelics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6expwg2_DRw), [non-monogamy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLME7num44)—edge-of-science moonshots—[biohacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HH0pdbnTM), [terraforming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4Hnv_ZJSQY), [chasing immortality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqxwE_-oZv4)—and shock jock contrarianism—[nicotine is good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EHE-hHg49k); a guide to stealing elections; [eugenics is misunderstood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9RjYeqsIXo), actually.[^1] From the outside, it was a bunch of TED talks about effective accelerationism held at Burning Man. From the inside, I have no idea what it was, because I did not go.

Regardless of the specifics, the conference represents a certain intellectual theme that’s relatively common among both Silicon Valley’s ruling elite and its Very Online underbelly: That the orthodoxy is wrong, that most people are mindless pawns to the bloated powers that be, and that one of the gravest threats to both America and to human civilization itself is those powers [trying to silence](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1758542692294783284) the free-thinking heretics. We need more people to question, [to challenge conventional wisdom](https://www.paulgraham.com/conformism.html), to ”think from first principles,” and to be brave enough to swim against the overwhelming [tides of groupthink](https://www.wsj.com/articles/like-peter-thiel-others-feel-alienated-by-silicon-valley-groupthink-1518962400) and mainstream opinion.

This rough ethos is everywhere in Silicon Valley. It shows up in our [most read blogs](https://www.paulgraham.com/woke.html), on our [most popular podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k1ehaE0bdU&t=892s), and as part of our [most selective job interviews](https://review.firstround.com/adam-grant-on-interviewing-to-hire-trailblazers-nonconformists-and-originals/). The rationalist blog [Astral Codex Ten](https://www.astralcodexten.com/) (née [Star Slate Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/)) is its most canonical form: Long essays, deeply linked to academic sites likes [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), and framed as intellectually curious and truth-seeking, but impossible to read without a sinking feeling that part of the motivation is to flirt with offensive ideas but never quite touch them.[^2] 

Anyway, my point is not to debate this strain of thought; it is simply to point out its undeniable existence. In Silicon Valley, according to our collective brand guidelines, the best of us are unflinching in the face of controversial ideas, and unafraid to think for ourselves.

Dissidents, however, don’t just exist at Miami meetups and in the bowels of Hacker News; in some cases, they make their way into mainstream media outlets. And several years ago, another dramatic example of heretical thinking landed on the front pages of the *New York Times Magazine:* [The 1619 Project](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html).

The collection of essays, which argues that slavery played a much more important part in America’s 400-year arc than is typically told in most history books, checks all of the boxes that Silicon Valley loves: It’s an ultimate narrative violation, rejecting centuries of conventional wisdom about the founding narratives of the United States. It’s deeply researched, riddled with references to academic scholarship. It’s a story of government failure, of state institutions that are corrupt and immoral, and of political leaders who self-serving and short-sighted. It’s a story of overextended regulation, of cronyism, and of market distortions. It’s a story of systems thinking, explaining how social elements are connected and intertwined, and how distant causes can have long-echoing effects. It’s a story of unappreciated actors, people held back by flawed policies, by the unchallenged beliefs of bad scientists, and by the comfortable bourgeois elite. And it’s controversial—a number of historians and supposed experts disagreed with it—just, I’m sure, as lots of doctors would disagree with people huffing nicotine. It was, in every sense, heretical.

And yet, I doubt—though I could be wrong!—that it was popular at Hereticon, nor does it seem to be popular among the broader community of technologists that orbit it. It may not be popular on this blog. People may scoff at it, roll their eyes at it, dismiss it as the work of an unserious shrill. But* why?* Why does *this* idea, despite its clear qualification as a [dangerous thoughtcrime](https://theblackwallsttimes.com/2022/12/07/nikole-hanna-jones-exposes-racist-letter-on-instagram/), feel out of place among Silicon Valley’s self-styled free thinkers, skeptics, and revolutionaries?

I mean, you know, there is that one thing. But to take a more generous view, my suspicion is that Silicon Valley contrarianism isn’t about a relentless pursuit of every truth; it’s about indulgence. The talks at Hereticon aren’t hard realities that make the people giving and watching them uncomfortable; they’re forbidden fruits that make *other people* uncomfortable. Hereticon’s speakers appear to frame their ideas as meeting two criteria—that they are controversial, and perhaps true—but I’d guess that there is also a third: That they *want* them to be true.

The core thesis of the 1619 Project is, for many people in Silicon Valley, something else. Though it doesn’t accuse today’s generations of wrongdoing, it complicates many of America’s traditional heroes, and asks us to think about our social stations, our successes or failures, and how we arrived at them. It is not an idea that gets us in a fun bit of rambunctious trouble; it is, more simply, an idea that a lot of people in Silicon Valley would rather not be *true*.[^3] 

No sense in contemplating something like that, I suppose.[^4]

I moved to San Francisco in 2012, out of a stale cubicle in Washington, DC, and into a half-billion dollar frat house. The company I joined was fairly typical for its era: Moving fast, breaking things, and having parties. We ate free lunches and catered dinners at the office. We conducted interviews drinking Coronas. Two product managers organized an official beer pong tournament every Friday. I bought a big wheel. We were loud, well fed, and on drugs.[^5] People flirted; people hooked up; dated; broke up; dated anew. Three engineering leaders dated marketers; one dated a designer, then a recruiter. Some people got married. It was a bender of excess and alcohol, and it was fun, [for me](https://benn.substack.com/p/delirium#:~:text=I%20was%20immediately%20hooked.%20The%20Kool%2DAid%20was%20spiked%2C%20and%20I%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20get%20enough.%C2%A0).

Of course, it wasn’t fun for everyone. Our raucous circus was unwelcoming to some; outright dangerous to others. Women got harassed, mistreated, and passed over for promotions. But for those of us of a certain demographic,[^6] we didn’t see that, not directly, not without looking. The suffering happened silently, later, in bathrooms we didn’t use and group texts that we weren’t invited to. Through the blurry eyes of a perpetual buzz, it was easy to dismiss the problems.

Until it wasn’t. The stories came out, at our company and [others](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber) [like](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html) [it](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html). The tech industry’s brand soured, the political winds turned, and we had to give away our toys. A new Silicon Valley emerged from our hangover: An attentive one; a sober one; a "woke" one. Human resources teams were hired; code bases were purged of their ASCII smut. We were told to grow up, because we were behaving like children.

Though much of it was a necessary correction—a bumpy curve towards progress, with veers in both directions—the new regime was delicate and uneasy. Good people wondered if there was a way to bring back the fun baby without the toxic bathwater; other people longed for both. But social pressures kept the tension roughly in balance, with [flare ups](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/business/dealbook/coinbase-social-activism.html) but no explosions.

—

Ah well. After years of keeping our music down, the party is back on, and we are making [Silicon Valley Great Again](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/us/politics/trump-party-peter-thiel-zuckerberg-vance.html). Tech is empowered, engorged, and enjoying itself. Its wealth used to gauche and understated; it is now [worn a million dollars at a time](https://www.gq.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-greubel-forsey-almost-one-million-handmade-watch). It is regressing to its baser self, reigniting the vulgarity of the previous decade, with righteous force. It is excited to say [retarded](https://x.com/search?q=from%3A%40JTLonsdale%20retarded&src=typed_query) again.[^7] It is codifying its excitement into [its terms of service](https://www.platformer.news/meta-new-trans-guidelines-hate-speech/).

We can bring it all back, if we want. Tech has always been an industry of bottomless wealth; in recent years, it has become one of unfathomable social power. Now, it has conquered Washington: We are in the [White House](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/business/dealbook/silicon-valley-trump-administration.html); in the [Oval Office](https://x.com/KanekoaTheGreat/status/1882535759204569407); we are trusted advisors; the [Vice President](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/28/jd-vance-peter-thiel-donors-big-tech-trump-vp/); the [co-president](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/13/elon-musk-trump-presidential-transition/).

We can do anything we want. To the victors go the spoils, and the spoils can be ghostwritten into an executive order. We can [build](https://a16z.com/its-time-to-build/) with reckless abandon. We can [accelerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_accelerationism) with the governor off. We can get launch permits to Mars. We can run roughshod over whatever norm we find annoying. We can indulge ourselves in the stories that we *want* to be true—that what is good for technology is good for humanity; that those who dislike our debauchery are the ones who need to grow up; that we [were right all along](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/01/mark-zuckerberg-free-expression/681238). We are [self-governed now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies), and our decency—and our [mercy](https://x.com/cspan/status/1881761682944397728)—must come from within.

—

But no, that is an exaggeration. There is at least one thing we can’t do: We cannot say the plain and obvious truth that, no matter how many of our pet projects he funds and how much bureaucratic red tape he cuts and how high the stock market goes, the president is an awful man doing awful things, for vengeance and money. His strategy is not to avoid scandal and savagery, but to flood the zone with it; to overwhelm us with so many new cruelties and so much naked corruption that we can’t digest any of it. We’re five days in, and there is already a [deportation force](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/01/23/schools-immigrant-families-trump-ice-raids/), threatening to raid schools; there are veterans’ families and unaccompanied minors, [left stranded on the tarmac](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-canceling-flights-nearly-1660-afghan-refugees-say-us-2025-01-20/) with reneged papers;[^8] there are [informant networks](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78wn5qg3nyo) snitching on their coworkers; there is the [“blatantly unconstitutional”](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3605g34jx5o) attempt to end birthright citizenship; there is entrusting the world’s largest fighting force with a man who allegedly [can’t stay sober](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/hegseth-senators-affidavit.html) long enough to not threaten his own wife; there are pardons for his [militia](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-pardons-jan-6.html); there are [investigations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/weaponization-government-executive-order-trump.html) for his enemies; there is [open auction](https://www.wsj.com/finance/trump-meme-coin-crypto-explained-c881afff) for his favor. He is bulldozing us, and giving us TikTok back as our opiate.

We may not want these things to be true, because we want an SEC that supports innovation in crypto, or a White House that convenes [a Manhattan project for AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/technology/trump-openai-stargate-artificial-intelligence.html). We may not want to live in a complex world of distant causes and long-echoing effects. It is easier to [say thank you](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/trump-announce-private-sector-ai-infrastructure-investment-cbs-reports-2025-01-21/), to put our heads down and our hands out, and pretend these other things are not happening or not our business. It is easier to stay silent. Because with Donald Trump, the famous quote—“First they came for the socialists…”—comes with a twist at the end: “But he never came for me—so long as I did not speak out.”

We are the most powerful industry in the world, rich beyond belief, [unfireable](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-mark-zuckerberg-cant-be-fired-as-meta-facebook-ceo-2022-11), with all of this civilization staring into our apps and the cradle of the next one being engineered in our labs. And if, despite all that, we cannot stand up to anything that is happening now—not even everything, but *anything*—perhaps we are not such brave heretics after all.

[^1]: All of these topics are listed in the agenda, but I could only find videos for some of them.

[^2]: The teaser for the eugenics talk at Hereticon is a good example of this. The video says, “aha, *technically*, eugenics includes any individual choice to increase desired genetic characteristics in the next generation, so being selective in who you date is a form of eugenics!” It’s a sort of semantic motte-and-bailey that’s engineered to trigger outrage, while hedging just enough to say that the people reacting to you are the unreasonable ones.

[^3]: Is it true? To me, yes, I believe it. But that’s beside the point. [As Hereticon founder Mike Solana says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMfeCPzTJzo&t=52s), his criteria for a good talk isn’t necessarily for him to believe it’s right; it’s to ask, "Is there interesting evidence here?" And if nothing else, the 1619 Project meets that bar.

[^4]: In fairness, it does happen sometimes; for example, when [David Sacks wondered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtlezdPNAI&t=1356s) if the [Google employees protesting Gaza](https://apnews.com/article/google-israel-protest-workers-gaza-palestinians-96d2871f1340cb84c953118b7ef88b3f), who were generally dismissed by most of Silicon Valley’s chattering elite, were on the noble side of history. It doesn’t happen often, but, credit where credit is due.

[^5]: It is only a mild exaggeration to say that the women’s bathroom had more cocaine than women.

[^6]: “Demographic” is only approximately correct. Yes, there were clear demographic patterns for who fit into this version of Silicon Valley’s culture and who didn’t, but there were many exceptions to those patterns.

[^7]: See footnote 2.

[^8]: Families, [these are the most important things](https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1882488641999819028?t=1422). If you can help someone save their marriage, that’s a lot more important and virtuous than most things we do.

# Another one

*DeepSeek becomes the first of many.*

![DJ Khaled Throws Us The Keys : NPR](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Bfw!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2c9ccea-981e-4dcf-aecc-305d89278c41_1280x720.jpeg)

On the one hand, most of this was pretty predictable, right? Though we may not have expected [a groundbreaking new large language model](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/technology/what-is-deepseek-china-ai.html) to come out of a Chinese hedge fund, weren’t open source LLMs always going to be, at worst, just behind the proprietary ones built by companies like OpenAI and Google? Weren't there always going to be improvements—in hardware, in training methods, in data collection and generation—that made creating yesterday’s state-of-the-art model cheaper? Shouldn't there always have been questions about whether or not building a frontier LLM [was a good business](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-ai-companies-work?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=The%20billions%20that%20OpenAI,eighteen%20months%20from%20dead)?

> The billions that OpenAI spent on building prior versions of GPT is not [a moat], because better versions of it are already [available for free on Github](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama). Stylistically, Anthropic put itself deeply in the red to build ten incrementally better models; eight are now worthless, the ninth is open source, and the tenth is the thin technical edge that is keeping Anthropic alive. Whereas cloud providers can be disrupted, it would almost have to happen slowly. Every LLM vendor is eighteen months from dead.

Admittedly, that post got two things wrong. First, eighteen months might have been too generous. It took less than a week for DeepSeek to blow [a trillion dollar hole](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/the-day-deepseek-turned-tech-and-wall-street-upside-down-f2a70b69) in the stock market, for it to become more popular than OpenAI in the [app](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/deepseek-displaces-chatgpt-as-the-app-stores-top-app/) [stores](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/deepseek-reaches-no-1-on-us-play-store/), for US government officials to declare it a [national security risk](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/white-house-evaluates-china-ai-app-deepseeks-affect-national-security-official-2025-01-28/), and for the American AI industry to [rediscover copyright law](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/david-sacks-claims-theres-substantial-evidence-that-deepseek-used-openais-models-to-train-its-own).[^1] And second, the main reason everyone lost their minds is because they thought models would advance in the same way I did—that, for “models to get better, pushing the frontier further out will likely get more difficult” because “the research gets more harder, and the absolute amount of compute required to train a new model goes up.” DeepSeek [blew up those assumptions too](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deepseek-suggests-ai-training-costs-114137061.html).[^2] But regardless, the market seemed fundamentally flimsy already: New versions of LLMs were always going to have short shelf lives, and there were always going to be [viable](https://x.com/SouthernValue95/status/1867339940159533419) open source alternatives. And now, more than ever, OpenAI’s most profitable business model [might be this one](https://benn.substack.com/p/ai-companies-are-just-saas-companies#:~:text=Or%2C%20alternatively%2C%20here%20is%20my%20proposal%20for%20Sam%20Altman%3A):

> Here is my proposal for Sam Altman:

Like, as a *consumer*, what is the best AI product you can imagine? What do you want in your ideal chatbot? For me, it’s two things: A bunch of neat features around the chatbot—the way to [upload documents](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8241126-what-kinds-of-documents-can-i-upload-to-claude-ai); a [nice workspace](https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/) for interacting with it; a browser agent that lets the model [click buttons for you](https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/) on the internet; a [history](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-ai-companies-work/comment/68953753) of the [things](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-ai-companies-work/comment/69015859) you’ve told it before; integrations between the bot and your email, your calendar, and the other tools you live in—and the *ability choose between different models. *I want Claude for creative stuff, ChatGPT to write code, and DeepSeek for its [unhinged reasoning](https://x.com/HWIgnorance/status/1882029585065214286).

In other words, I don’t want to subscribe to a research team and a slightly better model; I want to subscribe to a great product and model *broker. *[Microsoft gets it.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/microsoft-brings-a-deepseek-model-to-its-cloud/) But what company is better positioned to be the default destination for LLM distribution than the one that’s already visited by [hundreds of millions of people](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313097/chatgpt-300-million-weekly-users) a month?

On the other hand, no, nothing about this feels predictable anymore. Before DeepSeek came out, the pace of AI development was already disorienting: Ideas were urgent one month, [and passé the next](https://www.madrona.com/rag-is-not-enough-ai-data-architecture/). Groundbreaking companies [fossilized](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/jasper-an-early-generative-ai-winner-cuts-internal-valuation-as-growth-slows) in real time. Every week, there was another breakthrough, another startup [denoting out of the gate](https://benn.substack.com/p/is-growth-still-good#:~:text=Together%2C%20these%20two%20dynamics%20seem%20to%20be%20breaking%20the%20usual%20laws%20of%20startup%20growth.), and another reminder somewhere, someone was getting rich or rewriting history without you. Generational possibility was on your left, obsolescence was to your right, and existential opportunity costs were everywhere.

But the chaos had a pattern. The big labs would forge ahead at the frontier, clearing new territory with billion dollar bulldozers. The rest of us would rush in to decorate the landscape behind them. Project this forward, and you could see the hazy contours of our a likely future: The premier models would gradually get better and cheaper; we’d put them [in more products](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v--VUnFiWp4&t=405s); we’d tweak them with our data; big enterprises would [train their own](https://www.databricks.com/product/artificial-intelligence), so that they could have their own ChatGPT, but [tedious](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/digital-transformation/the-last-frontier-of-disruption-with-its-new-ai-chatbot-ey-teams-seek-to-take-the-pain-out-of-payroll-questions/); their own ChatGPT, but [smug about having gone to Wharton](https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/meet-lilli-our-generative-ai-tool); their own ChatGPT, but [Macheivellian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Koch).[^3] More and more things—[transactional emails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m0MoYKwVTM), call centers, copy editing, [homework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK8bnkcT0Ng)—would get automated; we’d make some [new emojis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XROs4K67Y9Q) and save our marriages with [montages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0BXZhdDqZM) of [slop](https://corp.oup.com/word-of-the-year/#shortlist-2024); [Jesus would take the wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsJB8Top3Tk). Software would keep eating the world, only more efficiently, with [less headcount](https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-will-hire-no-more-software-engineers-in-2025-says-marc-benioff/). The digital age would fade into the [intelligence age](https://ia.samaltman.com/). 

It was a frenzy, but bound by a kind of elastic gravity. With each step forward, the next one seemed destined to be harder—reserves of data were running dry; bigger models were more expensive. We were spinning faster, yes, but held in predictable orbit, like a ball being swung in circles with a rubber band.

Last week, the band snapped. DeepSeek broke the pattern, introduced a hard discontinuity, and sent us spiraling off course. And now we’re blasting across a new Rubicon, with no idea what’s on the other side.

Consider: What if DeepSeek had been just a little bit better at its original task of figuring out if stocks would go up or down? What if DeepSeek hadn’t been launched to global fanfare, but instead operated in quiet obscurity, silently upending financial markets by trading on [prime number patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OYex7I_b9g) that nobody else could see? What if that model already exists in some other hedge fund, and we don’t know about it?[^4]

Before DeepSeek, this didn’t seem possible; not *really.* It wasn’t all that conceivable that a company could build a revolutionary new LLM without spending conspicuous amounts of money on conspicuous amounts of hard-to-find hardware. Now, it’s conceivably within reach of every startup and trading desk. Advanced models are conceivably runnable on [every laptop](https://x.com/awnihannun/status/1881412271236346233). We are no longer living in a world where a few superpowers might build Skynet, but one in which Skynet could be anywhere.[^5]

Moreover, either by necessity or by design, major models like GPT-4 and Gemini are somewhat predictable. They have verbal tics, and because there were only a few of them, they’ve became somewhat familiar characters. DeepSeek is more [unsettling](https://x.com/Leo_Abstract/status/1882097751720427775); it has linguistic oddities and uneven expertise. And there will likely be thousands more, with their own temperaments and capabilities.

I’m not a doomer about this; I don’t think we’re barreling toward an [outright apocalypse](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/28/former-openai-safety-researcher-brands-pace-of-ai-development-terrifying), in which the machines become sentient and make us the yolks of their [Energizer eggs](https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Power_plant?file=The_Matrix_236.jpg). But I am a differentist (??[^6])—I don’t think we’re nearly imaginative enough about the variety of paths that are forking in front of us.

Social media started with a way for college kids to stalk their crushes and poke each other, and ended up [breaking](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2024-05-17/big-take-meme-financial-markets-with-matt-levine-podcast) the fundamental principles of finance, creating new pseudo-nation-states, and making [skincare stores](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/beauty/kids-are-having-birthday-parties-at-sephora-now/) the go-to destination for nine-year-olds’ birthday parties. People [are](https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/2/1/24056883/tiktok-self-promotion-artist-career-how-to-build-following) brands; brands [are](https://www.instagram.com/jakefromstatefarm/?hl=en) people; a reality show star is president. Social media didn’t just make it possible to [virtually experience events in real time](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/10/02/11-predictions-on-the-future-of-social-media.html); it dissolved entire pillars of our society, in wildly unpredictable ways.

Our forecasts for AI already seem too quaint though; too first-order. Though people predicted that there would probably be some weird moments, of [chatbots in court](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/nyregion/lawyer-chatgpt-sanctions.html) and teenagers wanting to take [an AI to prom](https://www.businessinsider.com/dating-ai-chatbot-replika-artificial-intelligence-best-thing-to-happen-2023-2), even the industry’s biggest boosters promised an unimaginative revolution. AI will “empower humanity,” [Reid Hoffman said](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/opinion/ai-chatgpt-empower-bot.html), by—and this is a comprehensive list of his actual examples of AI’s revolutionary muscle—telling us why we bought Bitcoin; alerting us to when we’ve been influenced by an ad[^7] or social media recommendation; suggesting better books to buy; and informing us that we’re unhappy about where we live because we tweet about how we’re unhappy about where we live.

This is not a new world; it is a streamlined one. It’s our same lives, algorithmically polished down to their most productive bearings. We will [buy plane tickets](https://venturebeat.com/ai/meet-openais-operator-an-ai-agent-that-uses-the-web-to-book-you-dinner-reservations-order-tickets-compile-grocery-lists-and-more/), with fewer clicks. We will generate [enterprise sales outreach campaigns](https://www.unifygtm.com), with less manual research. We will [post clickbait](https://www.blaze.ai/) on LinkedIn, without having to write it ourselves. It’s Jevons paradox of rote drudgery—by making our fake [email jobs](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fake-email-job) more efficient, we increase the demand for useless emails.[^8]

The real future is surely destined to be much weirder. If agents take over our web browsers, who will click on the ads that pay for the internet?[^9] If [bots read our emails](https://cora.computer/), what’s the point of spamming people with sales pitches and marketing emails? If work is increasingly done by [more computers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/events/FY-2023/Morgan-Stanley-TMT-Conference#:~:text=And%2040%25%20of%20the%20code%20they%27re%20checking%20in%20is%20now%20AI%2Dgenerated%20and%20unmodified.) and [fewer people](https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-will-hire-no-more-software-engineers-in-2025-says-marc-benioff/), how will entire economies that are built on variants of per-seat pricing—from commercial real estate to SaaS software—make money?

And now, we’re on the cusp of creating thousands more models, each with their own specializations, personalities, and emergent abilities. That’s what DeepSeek represents: Not one new weird model, but thousands. We won’t know what they can do, or who has which ones. A hedge fund could accidentally make [a peculiar screenwriter](https://x.com/jasminewsun/status/1883571680502747595). A petroleum company could discover new pharmaceuticals. A law student trying to shortcut their reading assignments could upend the entire legal industry.

Social media rewrote the [world’s physics](https://www.piratewires.com/p/jump-23d06adb4cb7) by breaking one long-standing societal law—that communication was bound by time and distance—and by making it possible for anyone to talk to everyone, all at once. AI cracks several more—that expertise takes time to accumulate; that reasoning has some [foundational legitimacy](https://benn.substack.com/i/89635026/foundational-legitimacy); that creativity does not scale—and now, anyone can do anything, almost immediately. What happens next is anyone’s guess, but I suspect it will have echoes far beyond better book recommendations and an emotional Fitbit.

[^1]: So here’s my question: [OpenAI says](https://openai.com/index/openai-and-journalism/) that it’s allowed to train its models on the text in The New York Times, while DeepSeek is not allowed to train its models using text generated by OpenAI because that [inappropriately distills their models](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/technology/openai-deepseek-data-harvest.html). But what if The Times wrote their articles using AI? What if they used Claude? Could The Times sue then? Could *Anthropic* sue? Is OpenAI allowed to scrape from The Times, because their content was created by people, but they aren’t allowed to scrape from Sports Illustrated, because their content [was created by a proprietary technology](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/sports-illustrated-found-publishing-ai-generated-stories-photos-and-authors)?

[^2]: [Maybe.](https://x.com/altcap/status/1884745222690844965)

[^3]: I once heard that Koch, Inc. built an internal chatbot that was meant to mimic Charles Koch, because, as they said, “their competitive advantage came from their principles” and their principles came from Charles Koch’s aphorisms about management.

[^4]: Of course, specialized models like this already exist in some hedge funds; that’s the entire point of a lot of hedge funds, to find these patterns and [exploit them](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-22/jane-street-s-1-billion-trade-puts-spotlight-on-indian-options). But that’s hard to do, takes a lot of research, and there is no generalizable model for finding lots of these patterns at once. I am sure tons of people are trying to build one though, and if they do, they probably won’t tell us about it.

[^5]: [Informed people](https://darioamodei.com/on-deepseek-and-export-controls#deepseek-s-models) say that DeepSeek isn’t cheaper to run because of any profound breakthroughs; it is, instead, “an expected point on an ongoing cost reduction curve.” But that’s somewhat beside the point; the point is that these models are now cheaper to run. That’s disruptive, even if it’s predictable.

[^6]: The first rule of being a differentist is to use different words than everyone else.

[^7]: The ad men used to sell us stuff by deploying their [refined emotional tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus) against our frail psychologies. In the future, I guess it’ll be the same, except it’ll be Proctor and Gamble’s AI supercluster versus our Alexa.

[^8]: [Jevons paradox strikes again!](https://x.com/satyanadella/status/1883753899255046301) As the hamster wheel gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of.

[^9]: The agents will? If it’s socially acceptable to harass and distract people with intrusive ads so that they buy stuff, why wouldn’t websites do the same thing to agents?

# For the brand, I guess

*What are we doing here?*

---

![Pat McAfee: The next ESPN College GameDay host? Twitter wants to see it.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4_J9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87dab006-43e4-4311-a143-1d873521d1f4_3200x1801.jpeg)
*The ascendent aesthetic.*

If you run a big venture capital firm, how do you decide who to hire?

The obvious answer is that you are in the company-picking business, so you want to hire people who are good at picking. Every year, thousands of small startups will email you asking you for money. They will all tell you that they have a revolutionary new idea; they will all send you a [tidy deck](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/sequoia-capital-pitchdecktemplate/46231251#2) that explains why the problem they’re solving is huge, why they have a novel solution, and why now is the moment for you to invest in them. But of course, most of these startups will be wrong: They won’t become big companies, and if you give them your money, they won’t be able to pay you back. You will lose money—sad!—your limited partners will stop giving you money to invest in other startups—bad!—and you will not get included on any fancy lists in Forbes—embarrassing! If you invest in the *right* companies, however, they will grow from plucky dorm room dreams into vast international conglomerates worth many billions of dollars. Your venture capital firm will stay in business—good!—you will become very rich—fun!—and you will [get](https://www.youtube.com/@allin) to [start](https://www.youtube.com/@Bg2Pod) a [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@ThisWontLastpodcast)—the dream!

So, hire the best pickers. Hire the experienced industry veterans, who’ve worked with hundreds of startups and evaluated thousands of fundraising pitches and can see success in a founder’s eyes. Hire the [data wunderkinds](https://fortune.com/2017/10/26/social-capital-data-investing/), who can extrapolate [a few months of business metrics](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/numbers-that-actually-matter-for-founders/75190075) into a billion dollar exit. Hire the people who can predict the future.

But no, that’s not quite right. Because if you are a prominent venture capital firm, you don’t just need to be good at picking; you also need to be good at *being picked*. Though some startups rise from obscure rags to generational riches, many of the successful ones are obviously good. Their revenue chart is [a vertical line](https://x.com/chaosofmoney/status/1887314259681677445); their founders [are tech celebrities](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/anthropic-is-the-new-ai-research-outfit-from-openais-dario-amodei-and-it-has-124m-to-burn/); their cap table is full of other [blue chip investors](https://technical.ly/startups/dbt-labs-just-raised-a-222m-series-d-for-a-4-2b-valuation-as-it-builds-the-modern-data-stack/#:~:text=Existing%20investor%2C,Snowflake%20also%20participated.); they have [all three things](https://benn.substack.com/p/is-growth-still-good#footnote-2-155016677) at once. To invest in these startups, you have to convince them to take your money over the money of dozens of other investors who also want in on the deal.

In other words, clever investors have to find the deal *and* win it; popular investors can partially outsource the picking, and focus more on the winning.

How do venture capital firms win? There are some options:

Or at least, it couldn’t. For a long time, investors, like colleges and big corporations, forged their brands on long histories of reliable results. They created esteemed legacies around venerable pillars like Loyalty, Determination, and Independence. This was hard and careful work, [built in drops and lost in buckets](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/kevin_plank_779026).

Simpler times, I guess. Now, reputations are created by poasting. They are created by [going direct](https://x.com/lulumeservey/status/1770111243174527264) and being [based](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnglishLearning/comments/mrz4yx/can_anyone_help_me_understand_the_word_based/), with dunks and dank memes. Celebrity and cultural cachet is no longer built brick by slowly-laid brick, but launched, by going viral on Joe Rogan. And it’s yet another arms race—if everyone is vying for algorithmic attention, the “best” brands are the loudest, and the ones most committed to their bit.

And so, the *New York Times* [reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/nyregion/daniel-penny-hired-andreessen-horowitz.html):

> Daniel Penny, a Marine veteran acquitted on a charge of criminally negligent homicide in Manhattan in December, has been hired by one of Silicon Valley’s most prestigious venture capital firms to join its “American Dynamism” team.
> Mr. Penny, a Long Island native and former architecture student, will work in a group that supports American interests, including the aerospace, defense and manufacturing sectors, according to the website of the company, Andreessen Horowitz.
> Mr. Penny was charged in 2023 by the Manhattan district attorney’s office with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide after a video of him fatally choking another passenger, Jordan Neely, on the subway circulated online that May.
> “We believe in Daniel and are excited to have him as part of our team,” David Ulevitch, a partner at the firm, wrote in a memo to employees on Tuesday that was relayed to The New York Times.
> Mr. Ulevitch said in the memo that the firm plans to teach Mr. Penny “the business of investing” and that he will support several of the firm’s portfolio companies. On Andreessen Horowitz’s website, Mr. Penny is listed as a “deal partner.”[^5]

I recently heard that another prominent VC firm tolerates a very controversial partner because they have valuable connections in valuable markets. It’s not that the firm supports his politics or his online personality, but they simply don’t care. The returns outweigh the reputational damage, and the ethics of the thing are immaterial. His employment is a business decision.

Penny is, I suppose, a different character from the same story. It’s unlikely that he has a traditionally useful Rolodex, but he is, [to some](https://x.com/JDVance/status/1886928702396883241), a trophy in the culture war. Putting him on the payroll proves Andreessen Horowitz’s political bona fides: That they are aligned, boldly aligned, with the increasingly emergent [aesthetic](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/aesthetic) of [masculinity](https://x.com/AFpost/status/1878206506635579493), [meritocracy](https://x.com/lessin/status/1886459870884639035),[^6] and Elon Musk—which is an aesthetic that is especially fashionable along the booming frontiers of AI, crypto, and the various Elon Musk sci-fi adjacencies. Though that brand—and Penny, to say the least—has plenty of other, uh, “problematic” associations, no matter: The ethics of the thing are immaterial.[^7] He was hired for the vibe—and today, vibes are business decisions.

But all this can probably be extrapolated one step further, through one more twist in the arcing evolution of venture capital.

Consider [David Perell](https://twitter.com/david_perell). The self-described “Writing Guy” has nearly half a million followers on Twitter, hosts a podcast that’s booked some [impressive guests](https://www.youtube.com/@DavidPerellChannel/videos), and [used to run](https://writeofpassage.com/blog/final-cohort) an online writing course called [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/).

But one thing Perell doesn’t seem to do very much of is write. As best I can tell, he’s written two posts for [his blog](https://perell.com/essays/) over the last year. Perell’s *brand* is definitely writing, and his *career *is kind of writing, but his *work *is not writing. Writing is a means to famous ends.[^8]

Perell’s course said this explicitly: “When you publish your ideas online, you unleash the full power of the Internet…Writing online will unlock opportunities and build your future.” On one page about the course, [he shows graphs](https://web.archive.org/web/20240206030323/https://take.writeofpassage.school/) of former students’ growing follower counts, with annotations for when they took the course.

This, though, is the world we live in now. Being an internet celebrity is the ultimate ambition. You don’t monetize attention; popularity and fame are [what you ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/29/elon-musk-video-games-diablo-path-exile/)*[buy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/29/elon-musk-video-games-diablo-path-exile/)*.

And so it’s becoming with venture capital. What Silicon Valley is doing here is no longer a quiet game of money allocation; it is also about having fans. The business model is inverted—the [media company](https://www.newcomer.co/p/andreessen-horowitz-and-the-future) and popular podcasts aren’t about deal flow; *they are the point*. The audience is the point; the [likes and digital hugs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPqDIwWMtxg&t=114s) are the point; the [tweets from JD Vance](https://x.com/JDVance/status/1886928702396883241) are the point.

If you run a big venture capital firm, how do you decide who to hire? Whoever gets you attention. Whoever inspires more tweets and [Substack posts](https://benn.substack.com/p/for-the-brand-i-guess). Whoever is provocative, and [gets the people going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eRRab36XLI). All press is good press, it seems, because even capitalists—from [financiers](https://x.com/BillAckman) to [founders](https://benn.substack.com/p/ambition-then-and-now?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=In%20other%20words%2C%20Korey,to%20outclimb%20our%20peers.)—have [more base desires and addictions](https://www.newyorker.com/news/essay/on-the-internet-were-always-famous) than money.

[^1]: Though it could work now? Tiger overpaid for deals in 2021, when startups were already [grossly overvalued](https://www.meritechcapital.com/benchmarking/historical-trading-data/ev-ntm-revenue) (though that’s not entirely exogenous; they were overvalued in part because of firms like Tiger). It seems like a somewhat open question Tiger’s approach would work in more normal times.

[^2]: But there are some! Tiger [tried that too](https://randle.substack.com/p/playing-different-games#:~:text=In%20contrast%20to,them%20for%20something)—for example, they offered term sheets after doing minimal diligence, and took no board seats. It was very chill, very effective, and, ultimately, very expensive.

[^3]: They’re not a regular enterprise; [they’re a cool enterprise](https://www.capitalone.com/digital/the-lab/#:~:text=Embracing%20a%20start%2Dup%20mentality).

[^4]: Celebrities figured this out a long time ago. Nobody wants Kevin Durant’s introductions to Walmart’s IT team; everyone wants to [hang out with Kevin Durant](https://35v.tv/).

[^5]: Full disclosure: I have a loose professional relationship with Andreessen Horowitz through their scout program, through which I’ve made five investments in three years.

[^6]: In this context, lol.

[^7]: Or, you know, they are material in the other direction, and point is to stick it to the libs. This is pretty [in vogue](https://benn.substack.com/p/good-lord#:~:text=Ah%20well.%20After,of%20service.) these days too.

[^8]: In fairness, when Perell shut down his writing course, he said he’s “eager to double-down on [his writing podcast] and prioritize my own writing again. And who knows? Maybe it’s time to write a book.”

# Achievement, here and there

*A pivot.*

*There?*

Silicon Valley loves [the pivot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1vfXoUNDYA).

More than it loves the overnight success, it loves the story of the do-or-die entrepreneur, down to their last dime, and unafraid to roll the dice one more time.[^1] It loves dreams, halfway dead, brought back to life with a brilliant insight and a fearless gamble. Dynastic wealth, snatched from the jaws of bankruptcy; a plan, [punched in the face](https://rowansimpson.com/quotes/punch/) and on its heels, back for another round; when [the barbarians are at the gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarians_at_the_Gate), the [Horn of Helm Hammerhand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClA-SnkQR_I), one last time. In Silicon Valley, this is [the crucible](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-the-paypal-mafia-redefined-success-in-silicon-valley/#:~:text=Conversely%2C%20if%20you,build%20a%20company.); this is [the culture](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1gd31dc/til_nvidias_unofficial_company_motto_is_our/); this is [Sparta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABQQHwf4sYA).[^2] The pivot is the romantic stuff in a startup—ingenuity, grit, bold optimism and ambitious tenacity—all in a single maneuver. [Because I could not stop for Death – I pivoted –.](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47652/because-i-could-not-stop-for-death-479)

But there is also something revealing in the pivot. When people start companies, their fundraising decks and “About us” pages say that they’re the perfect founders to build *this* product for *this* market at *this* time. They talk about how, when they were [a product manager at Ramp](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-trenderprise?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=How%20is%20some%2025%2Dyear%2Dold%20PM%20from%20Ramp%20supposed%20to%20compete%20with%20that%3F), they saw the frustrations that traveling salespeople have with submitting *per diem* expenses. They say that this experience is broken, that they love helping teams save time and money, and something about the [intelligence age](https://ia.samaltman.com/). They say they’re building software by finance teams, for finance teams. They reverse engineer their personal histories to explain how so many of their professional decisions led them to this point, which is exactly where they want to be.[^3] They use the words “passion” and “corporate expenses” in the same sentence.

Or at least, they do at first. Because if that product flops fast enough—before the company runs out of money, more or less—they’ll move on to a better idea, and a new calling. The market for expense software was too fragmented, but maybe we can pivot into an automatic note-taking app for field sales reps. The [real-time feedback app for college professors](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6p-all-about-pivoting#:~:text=Segment%2C%20they%20were,tell%20the%20professor.) was a bust, but maybe it’s a good data infrastructure tool? [Organizing bourbon meetups](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/instagram-used-to-be-called-brbn/373815/) didn’t work, so maybe sharing photos will?

These swerves are so common in Silicon Valley that we don’t question them. Instead, [we name them](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze), celebrate them, and treat them like a normal part of every startup’s zigzag of life. But it would be weird if this happened elsewhere?

Like, suppose you’ve been working at a restaurant—say, [The Ramp](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a2FScdXQpiBnvCRJ6)—and you want to start a bar that [serves gimmicky San Francisco-themed cocktails](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-much-for-that-dag-in-the-window#:~:text=My%20bar%20would%20be%20Frisco%E2%80%99s%2C%20located%20in%20Hayes%20Valley%20in%20San%20Francisco.%20The%20outside%20will%20be%20unassuming%20and%20understated%3B%20the%20inside%20will%20be%20a%20gaudy%20and%20obnoxious%20carnival.). Why might you start that bar? There are at least two reasons:

Presumably, most people start bars for something like the first reason: They want to run a bar and invent some cocktails. Small businesses, it seems, are created to be that small business—to serve goofy drinks, or coffee, or fix bicycles, or drive concrete trucks to construction sites. They may not be passions, but they have purpose. And when death stops for a bar, it doesn’t pivot into bail bonds; *it goes out of business*. Pawn shops don’t become bakeries. Liquor stores don’t launch laundromats.

But what are the foundational studs of a startup? What is the unmovable bedrock that makes it *it*? What knob would a founder rather die than turn?

For most companies, I’m not sure there is one. Because, at their most honest core, startups don’t exist to solve a specific problem; they exist to make something, anything, [that people want](https://paulgraham.com/good.html). What thing, for whom—it doesn’t matter, so long as they want it.

In other words, startup founders run a bar that serves gimmicky San Francisco-themed cocktails for the second reason. They do it because they want to get rich; to be admired; to work with their friends; to make an impact; to be their own boss; to impress their peers and [spite](https://x.com/josh_wills/status/1529958823749816321) their enemies; to have fun; to have [autonomy, mastery, and purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us). They do it for reasons that are both cynical and wholesome, but they rarely do it just for cocktails or expense reports. These things are instead [circumstantial vehicles of ambition](https://benn.substack.com/p/ambition-then-and-now?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20both%20of,a%20meaningful%20scale.%E2%80%9D), the disposable boosters of a hopeful rocket ship. Nobody will quite say this—the Ramp PM starting with say expense reports [are their cause](https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-25/on-the-fringe/uncanny-valley/#:~:text=THE%20MEETING,here%20for%20it.), and people will [compliment them on how beautiful their cause is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes)—but everyone knows that the real cause is survival[^4] and success.

Success, though, is social. The people who chase it aren’t just chasing a second home in the mountains, or a bank account of a certain size; they are chasing status. They are climbing a ladder, and often care as much about how high they *look* as how high they* are*.[^5] 

Obviously, this is hardly a profound point; of course people care about what others think of them. Money is one thing, but [you can’t fake influence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDorKy-13ak&t=611s).

Still, it has notable consequences. Silicon Valley has a long history of talking about “[changing the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8C5sjjhsso),” and the people who join startups have a compulsive habit of saying they’re doing it because they want to “make an impact.” But these motivations have qualifications: We want to change the world with technology, and make an impact in a way that is prestigious here.

For example, Aaron Levie, the founder and CEO of Box, an enterprise file storage company that makes [$1 billion a year](https://www.boxinvestorrelations.com/news-and-media/news/press-release-details/2024/Box-Reports-Fiscal-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results/), has [2.5 million followers](https://x.com/levie) on Twitter. Dirk Van de Put, the CEO of the food and beverage company Mondelez International, which oversees dozens of household brands and makes more than [$36 billion a year](https://ir.mondelezinternational.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mondelez-international-reports-q4-and-fy-2024-results), has [3,100 followers](https://x.com/Dirkvandeput). Levie also has [74,000 followers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/boxaaron/) on LinkedIn; Janno Lieber, the CEO of the New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which makes almost [$7 billion a year](https://www.mta.info/budget/MTA-operating-budget-basics) in fares and [transports millions of people](https://www.mta.info/agency/new-york-city-transit/subway-bus-ridership-2023) every day, has [874](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janno-lieber-32b487158/). Though these are imperfect measuring sticks, they’re indicative of our social scoreboard: Celebrity isn’t about just money or making a difference, but about startups, software, and following the [brand guidelines of being a builder](https://benn.substack.com/p/good-lord?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=Anyway%2C%20my%20point%20is%20not%20to%20debate%20this%20strain%20of%20thought%3B%20it%20is%20simply%20to%20point%20out%20its%20undeniable%20existence.%20In%20Silicon%20Valley%2C%20according%20to%20our%20collective%20brand%20guidelines%2C%20the%20best%20of%20us%20are%20unflinching%20in%20the%20face%20of%20controversial%20ideas%2C%20and%20unafraid%20to%20think%20for%20ourselves.).

That’s why we built [140 characters instead of flying cars](https://thevcfactory.com/we-wanted-flying-cars-instead-we-got-140-characters-peter-thiel/), and [recreated our parents as apps](https://www.businessinsider.com/san-francisco-tech-startups-replacing-mom-2015-5): Because you can build a company on those ideas, and building a company is what we celebrate. What it does doesn’t *really* matter, just as it doesn’t *really *matter to a founder what they pivot into.

A year ago, I spent a couple days with people who work in the public health and economic development division of a large Indian IT firm. Their team’s mission was to recruit more young Indians to work on these problems, and they’d been struggling: The best talent liked the trophies offered by major consulting and accounting firms. Despite the importance of the issues the team was working on, the hundreds of millions of lives that could be improved by them, and the comparable pay that they could offer, people preferred the status of McKinsey and KPMG.

But they had recently piloted a program that was changing that. Instead of hiring people directly, they created an investment fund, and reframed their mission around entrepreneurship. They called it an incubator, held Shark Tank-style pitches, accepted companies into cohorts, and hosted a demo day at the end. Though the pay was probably worse—the employees were founders of small startups, rather than employees of a multinational corporation—the job was cooler.

It was working. A spoonful of startup sugar helps the civic medicine go down.

To get the political part out of the way, whatever Elon Musk and his gang of Bebops and Rocksteadys are doing in Washington is clearly illegal. If Congress passes a law that requires the United States Treasury to put a trillion dollars into a hole and light it on fire, then not doing that is breaking the law. People may not want to do it; they may think that keeping the trillion dollars[^6] is “good,” or “justified,” or “based,” but is definitely not “allowed.” You do not get to drive 100 miles per hour because it is fun; you do not get to make your own laws because you built a big company or won a Mensa contest. The Constitution only matters because people do what it says. There is a fragile magic to all of this—to a collective agreement to follow the rules, even if some of those rules displease us—and we are snuffing it out.

Anyway. Something smaller is happening in this moment too. For years, Silicon Valley has looked at Washington with [a suspicious side-eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9cO3-MLHOM), and given little credit to the work that happens there. In tech, there has been no prestige in policymaking.

Now, there is. Policy suddenly matters, as do the people who work in it. Tech celebrities are calling unelected bureaucrats [national treasures](https://x.com/natfriedman/status/1886503046299181444). Government jobs are “[a blast](https://vinay.sh/i-am-rich-and-have-no-idea-what-to-do-with-my-life/#:~:text=The%20next%204%20weeks%20of%20my%20life%20consisted%20of%20100s%20of%20calls%20recruiting%20the%20smartest%20people%20I%E2%80%99ve%20ever%20talked%20to%2C%20working%20on%20various%20projects%20I%E2%80%99m%20definitely%20not%20able%20to%20talk%20about%2C%20and%20learning%20how%20completely%20dysfunctional%20the%20government%20was.%20It%20was%20a%20blast.).” Fights about DOGE are in our group chats and on our message boards, and the nexus of discourse has moved to Washington, so much so that it feels weird to write blogs like this one and *not* mention it. A new social scaffold has emerged in Silicon Valley, supporting a new form of success. Changing the world now means something other than creating another enterprise SaaS app.

I’m not sure it’ll last. Part of this is probably novelty: We’re hypnotized by the gossip and rubbernecking at the spectacle of the whole thing. At some point, we’ll probably get bored,[^7] we’ll get distracted by some new [technical bombshell](https://benn.substack.com/p/another-one), and we’ll go back to debating AI and ignoring DC. 

But, again, there is something revealing in the pivot. Even if it’s temporary, our turn to Washington is a reminder that our attention isn’t fixed, and that ambition is relative, and that achievement, even in Silicon Valley, isn’t only here and not there.

[^4]: Here’s another question: What does it mean for a business to fail? A coffee shop that stopped serving coffee would probably be considered a failure. But an expense filing startup that stopped managing expenses? The *idea *failed, but the business didn’t. A startup can discontinue its products, replace its founders, and wipe out its investors, and still be the same startup as it was before. It can fire everyone—which is equivalent to missing payroll, for all practical intents and purposes—and still be considered alive. In other words, so long as a startup could still succeed at *anything*, it hasn’t failed.

[^5]: Like, what would you do if you weren’t *allowed* to consider anyone else’s opinion? Not, “what do you want to do?,” because you may say, “I want to play in the NBA” or “I want to be a CEO,” and we often want those jobs because other people think they’re cool and prestigious. But would we want to play in the NBA or be a CEO if it came with the same status and fame as being a software engineer, or running a cafe, or driving an Uber?Though I have no idea if this is a useful question to ask, it’s telling how hard it seems to answer. Ironically, we are often more attuned to other people’s opinions than we are to our own.

*[Fads are a flat circle.](https://www.tiktok.com/@nicolestorydent/video/7469873185769458974)*

Before getting into the usual nonsense, we’re launching a temporary new feature here at benn.substack.com: *The* *White Lotus* Power Rankings.[^1] As I’m sure many of you are aware, *The White Lotus *is an HBO show about terrible people doing terrible things in beautiful places. Someone usually dies; we don’t know who; there are many deserving candidates. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy than you will inside a* White Lotus* hotel,[^2] and [you must be cautious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcb4_QwP6fE).

That’s the intrigue of the show—it’s part whodunit and part trolley problem, in which we all argue over who, among a basket of deplorables, is the most irredeemable. So, as someone who loves a dumb debate as much as [I love a dumb survey](https://benn.substack.com/p/results-actually), I have to ask: Who’s your champion? If there are twelve Marie Antoinettes tied to twelve different train tracks and you only have one trolley, what do you do?

I’ll ask each week, as the atrocities unfold. And whoever first predicts the killer and the victim wins a stay in the Pineapple Suite.[^3]

# Databricks

In late 2021, an analytics startup hosted a conference about the “future of data.” During the closing keynote, a notable venture capitalist made a bold forecast: In the coming years, most major enterprise software applications were going to be rebuilt on top of data warehouses like Snowflake and Databricks. Soon, everything, from CRMs and ERPs to CPQs and ATSs,[^4] were going to be “warehouse-native.” It was a trillion-dollar transformation, and the modern data stack—the dizzying explosion of data tools built to connect to the same databases—was just the beginning.

The prediction had a satisfying promise. Back then, in those medieval times, every SaaS application was built on top of its own internal database. If a company used Salesforce, Salesforce kept its own list of who it thought were their customers. If they used Zendesk, it kept a second list. Marketo kept a third, Jira a fourth, Stripe a fifth, all the way until they had [112 different lists](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-number-of-saas-applications-at-companies-declined-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-302199899.html), flimsily held in sync by [shoddy bilateral integrations](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-modern-data-experience?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=The%20data%20ecosystem,of%20guiding%20principles.) and [Jeff’s Airflow scripts](https://benn.substack.com/p/will-we-ever-have-clean-data?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=messy%20data%2C%20mismatched%20dashboards%2C%20broken%20pipelines%2C%20the%20three%20thousand%20single%2Dtenant%20Db2%20databases%20that%20are%20four%20versions%20behind%20and%20running%20in%20a%20data%20center%20that%20Jeff%20set%20up%20in%20Milpitas).[^5]

Unfortunately, 112 lists is 111 lists more than most companies want. So, people sunk endless hours into “harmonizing” their lists. They argued about which one was right. They sent marketing emails to customers who were already customers asking them to become customers again; they sent notes to customers who were no longer customers thanking them for being loyal customers. Data teams spent their lives comparing the lists, [looking for scary numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gnffe374Upw) and staring into the static.

Problems of the past, [we](https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/a-2020-perspective/) all [thought](https://pchase.substack.com/p/thenewbackend). Rather than every tool maintaining their own mismatched list,[^6] companies should keep *one* list, in a database all their own. If a tool needs that list, they won’t create a new one; they’ll use the existing one. And if a company needs to update the list, they update it once, in one place.

Now, [normally](https://benn.substack.com/p/entity-layer#:~:text=When%20Martin%20Casado%2C%20a%20partner%20at%20Andresseen%20Horowitz%2C%20was%20asked%20why%20he%20thought%20the%20data%20industry%20was%20a%20trillion%20dollar%20market%20and%20what%20bets%20he%E2%80%99d%20make%20about%20where%20it%E2%80%99s%20going%2C%20this%20was%20his%20response.), somewhere in the paragraphs above, I’d add a link to the investor’s talk. But I can’t, because the video no longer exists. The conference was hosted by a startup that was partly built on this general idea, and that startup went out of business. So did [others](https://www.supaglue.com/blog/pivoting-to-supaglue). The [modern data stack microsite](https://web.archive.org/web/20241009135733/https://www.moderndatastack.xyz/companies), which would’ve made for a fun link from “dizzying explosion of data tools,” [is gone](https://www.moderndatastack.xyz/). The whole [modern data stack movement is dead](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/is-the-modern-data-stack-still-a), cringe and out of fashion—replaced, obviously, with AI. Snowflake is the [AI data cloud](https://www.snowflake.com/en/). dbt Labs tells us that [gen AI runs on data](https://www.getdbt.com/). And we’ve all quietly quit on our warehouse-native CRMs, and are loudly pivoting into [AI](https://attio.com/)-[native](https://www.getclarify.ai/) [CRMs](https://www.creatio.com/).

In hindsight, it’s easy to see why it was so hard to make one list to rule them all. People often buy tools like Salesforce and SAP *because* of their [complex features and endless options](https://benn.substack.com/p/category-collapse#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20killer%20feature%3B%20there%20is%20no%20sharp%20disruptive%20wedge.%20That%E2%80%99s%20why%20Alteryx%20makes%20almost%20a%20billion%20dollars%20a%20year%2C%20despite%20seeming%20like%20an%20easy%20target%20for%20startups.%20The%20maze%20of%20complexity%20is%20its%20defense.%20Trying%20to%20build%20a%20simplified%20Alteryx%20is%20how%20you%20lose%20to%20Alteryx.) for customization. If you want to compete with these products, crossing their labyrinthine moat is [hard enough on its own](https://benn.substack.com/p/why-are-we-still-surprised-that-startups?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=The%20downside%20of,of%20crimes.); it turns out to be nearly impossible when you hand over control of core elements of your software, like the list of customers in a CRM, to someone else. You can build a trailer on a modular foundation, but you can’t build a mansion, and enterprises like their mansions. So that was the story of our warehouse-native future: Moments of gold and flashes of light, but mostly things we’d never do again.

[But fads are loops, and it’s all coming back to us now?](https://www.tiktok.com/@nicolestorydent/video/7469873185769458974) Sorta? I think? From software giant SAP, the full transcript of [the announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG-YaIlIj-4) about “one of their biggest launches” in their 53-year history:

> Today, we are actually announcing a breakthrough offering. We're doing one of our biggest launches in SAP's history: Business Data Cloud.
> Every company has today, big, big data silos, and what we are doing with Business Data Cloud, is, actually, bringing all the data together—SAP and non-SAP data. We are building the industry's leading data platform.
> Data is the lifeblood sustaining an organization to allow it to pivot in this new digital economy. And the more you can bring it together, and get access to it quickly, the more you can put it in context, you can start to use it, and you can start to navigate your business to the next level.
> Our customers have to stitch each of the lanes manually and individually for them to make sense of it. And when they do that, they lose context of the data and the semantical[^7] richness. So this completeness of the solution that allows our customers to take advantage of AI is something that is truly unique in the market.
> And all the agents, from the frontline to supply chain to finance, will work together, and they will be the smartest agents in the industry because they are sitting on high quality data offered by Business Data Cloud.
> The one thing that's, to me, amongst many, that's really exciting about Business Data Cloud is the partnership with Databricks, because what it is doing is bringing two powerhouses together into a singular offering for our customers, with SAP, with its breadth of business suite and the most mission critical and most important data that these applications create, harmonized in a way which is critical for any AI aspirations and any value.
> I think for SAP, it's huge, because now the applications that are all tied to this, as well as adding AI to it, will really help an organization transform to the next level, and it's badly needed in the digital economy. And so we are very excited about the offering, really delivering value to our customers.

Tremendous. I too am excited about the offering, and the value, and completeness of the solution that will navigate my business to the next level in this new digital economy. So maybe Databricks [will tell us what it actually is?](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-sap-databricks)

> …
> Our new offering, SAP Databricks, is sold by SAP as part of SAP Business Data Cloud on Azure, AWS, and GCP. SAP Databricks provides customers artificial intelligence, data warehousing, and data engineering capabilities, all governed by Unity Catalog. …
> SAP Databricks will have all the relevant datasets enriched and ready to be used for everything from data warehousing to building AI that can reason on that data. …
> The real magic of this partnership is that enterprises can easily combine their SAP data with the rest of their enterprise data. SAP Business Data Cloud empowers customers to unlock insights and business value of context-rich SAP data in both SAP Databricks and all existing and new Databricks deployments via Delta Sharing.

I mean. I don’t really know what’s happening here, nor have I ever been able to figure out what SAP does, or even what an ERP is. But here is what I think is going on:

Which, sure, this is how databases work now. About ten years ago, [they got split in half](https://benn.substack.com/p/postgres-in-a-box), into a bucket of data on one side, and a compute engine that runs calculations on the other. So long as the buckets are formatted correctly, you can mix and match different buckets with different calculators.

But this SAP product, if it works the way I think it does, extends that idea in a couple of new ways. First, it suggests that applications, like CRMs and ERPs to CPQs and ATSs, could be one of the buckets that databases connect their calculators to. Rather than exporting data out of SAP—which is how [people have done this for a while](https://web.archive.org/web/20240423214253/https://www.databricks.com/resources/webinar/integrating-sap-data-into-your-databricks-lakehouse#:~:text=Extract%20and%20combine%20SAP%20master%20and%20transactional%20data%20into%20one%20Common%20Data%20Model%20(CDM)%2C%20consumable%20by%20Databricks%20and%20other%20cloud%20services), and it clearly [hasn’t gone well](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-sap-databricks#:~:text=Using%20that%20essential%20data%20with%20modern%20data%20platforms%20outside%20SAP%20has%20been%20daunting%20and%20hard.)—SAP can simply reformat it. Then, people can bring their database—or, since it’s 2025, bring their aGeNtS—directly to the applications themselves.

It could go even further. In their video, SAP said “we are bringing all the data together—SAP and non-SAP data.” That implies that SAP’s analytics product might be able to read from buckets other than their own. Or, more generally, the calculators that read from the open source buckets don’t have to be databases. They could also be an *application’s* calculator.

In other words, the whole warehouse-native idea might’ve been a bad one, but not entirely. If the world gradually coalesces around common data storage frameworks, people might not rebuild applications on top of databases but on top of *data formats.* A BI tool could run a DuckDB engine and connect it directly to SAP’s Iceberg bucket. A marketing tool could read from Stripe’s bucket. The next AI BDR could read from a CRM’s bucket. It’s not quite one customer list to rule them all, but it’s a bit closer.

Now, I’m not sure that any of this works. The architectural crosstalk of an application reading from another application’s backend is almost certainly a more heinous knot than the “warehouse-native” one. But maybe not? You could at least imagine some tight partnerships working this way, where integrations between some CRMs and marketing tools are maintained through this sort of structure. 

My favorite definition of the modern data stack is that it’s data tools [that launched on Product Hunt](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-new-philosophers?utm_source=publication-search#footnote-3-113305279)—they’re the data tools that came out when people cared about Product Hunt, that sold to people who read Product Hunt, and that have a sort of Zillennial marketing aesthetic that Product Hunt embraced. For better or for worse, SAP and Databricks are none of those things. But maybe that’s the point: Trillion-dollar transformations start whizbang brands on Twitter, but end with the SAP Business Technology Platform ([SAP BTP](https://www.sap.com/products/erp.html#:~:text=SAP%20Business%20Technology%20Platform%20(SAP%20BTP))).

# Data bricks

I periodically wonder how aerospace engineers feel about airplanes. I have a very rough understanding of how flying works—it’s the lift, and Bernoulli's principle, and something about how the wing is shaped like a slug that’s in a hurry—but I mostly have to suspend disbelief, and let physics take the wheel. Planes fly for the same reason that magnets attract: It’s just how things work, and [you’re better off not asking any more questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn_8).

But if you spent a lifetime studying airplanes, do you see it differently? Does it become intuitively obvious that airplanes can fly, no more unnatural than boats floating and cars not dissolving through the road? Or does knowing more about airplanes make the whole thing feel even more tenuous, held together by [forgotten bolts](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/faulty-door-panel-alaska-airlines-flight-no-bolts-installed-ntsb-says-rcna136416) and inexplicable science?

I have other questions. When doctors need surgery for themselves, do they breezily dive under the knife, knowing that decades of precise trials and careful training is behind every incision? Or do they just hope to wake up, because they’ve seen doctors ChatGPT their way through the MCATs and Red Bull their way through 40 straight hours of operations? Do iron workers walk into construction sites confident in the engineering standards that are above their heads, or are they terrified by how many shortcuts people take to cheat those standards? Do sushi chefs know that every piece of fish is inspected by an exacting executive chef, or do they know that every kitchen is full of warring cooks who are more worried about revenge than what they [roll up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari) in your sushi?

I wonder about all of this because the more I learned about the world I worked in—data and its related parties—the more it revealed itself to be a horrific Rube Goldberg machine. Leading tech companies aren’t full of [futuristic computers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRELLH86Edo) that aggregate their vast surveillance infrastructure into some piercing Eye of Sauron; they are full of people wondering why their lists don’t match.

Case in point: When I worked at Microsoft—one of the [biggest](https://companiesmarketcap.com/) and [most profitable](https://companiesmarketcap.com/most-profitable-companies/) companies in the world, the pinnacle of economic success and scientific achievement, the sort of company that [invents new states of matter](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/technology/microsoft-quantum-computing-topological-qubit.html) and makes the United States the technological envy of the world—we were trying to figure out how many people used O365, the online version of Office. The question was unanswerable. We heard rumors that there was a 6,000 line script that could parse some logs and approximate a guess, but nobody had ever seen it run. If an exec asked about O365 adoption, someone  glued together a bunch of numbers in Excel. We all laugh at FTX for their [terrible balance sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Invest_Voyager/comments/ytomtg/ftxs_balance_sheet_just_leaked_wtf_and_9_billion/) of one-off math and “hidden, poorly labeled accounts,” but we are all FTX; it’s just a matter of degree.[^10]

Anyway, it seems like one of the new features of 2025 will be the [DOGE team](https://www.tiktok.com/@agiftfromtodd/video/7467699509397556526) joyriding their way through government databases and [live-tweeting about it](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891350795452654076). I have no idea if they’ll find any real fraud or not, but they will definitely find a lot of messy data. We shouldn’t be shocked or offended by that; in fact, it would be much more shocking—and suspicious—if they *didn’t* have it. 

Which, sure, clean would be better. [That’s what America wants; nice, calm data](https://youtu.be/KDorKy-13ak?si=8czCMaG5eObeSeOo&t=590). But to expect that is to expect government agencies to be not like us.

# Gold bricks

Speaking of airplanes, last month, I talked about Hugo Chavez’s quest to [fly Argentina’s gold](https://benn.substack.com/p/hotel-california) back from London. Several people emailed me to ask if he was successful, and if I knew where the gold was today. The answer, it seems, is that it’s being [flown back and forth between London and New York](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/why-dealers-are-flying-gold-bars-by-plane-from-london-to-new-york-86824199):[^11]

> President Trump’s threatened tariffs on Europe have thrown precious-metal markets into disarray. Gold prices have been driven to record highs, and a yawning gap has opened in the value of the yellow metal in its two trading hubs, New York and London.
> Gold is, for the moment, worth substantially more in Manhattan than in the U.K. capital, sparking the biggest trans-Atlantic movement of physical bars in years. Traders at major banks are racing to yank gold from vaults deep below London’s medieval streets and from Swiss gold refineries and ferry them across the ocean.
> The cheapest way to transport such a valuable commodity safely: the cargo hold of commercial planes.

On the internet, your money is everywhere, all at once. That’s convenient, but boring. When your money is a pile of rocks locked in Gringotts—or Fort Knox, [maybe](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGSEWJoxMBe/)—there are so many more opportunities for shenanigans. Yet another way the internet is [optimizing all the fun away](https://www.amazon.com/Filterworld-How-Algorithms-Flattened-Culture/dp/0385548281).

The wildest part of this story, though, is how people are keeping up with it:

> [Banks could avoid losses by] flying the physical gold they owned in London to New York and delivering it to the futures contracts’ owners instead, said Robert Gottlieb, a retired gold-trading executive whose LinkedIn posts on the disarray have become required reading in the market.

A confirmed case; the virus is out; we have to flatten the curve. LinkedIn has [broken containment](https://benn.substack.com/p/ed-harris-would-like-to-connect-with?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=But%20what%20goes,PR%20Newswire%20either.).

# The end of YC

*When engineers lose their edge.*

*[come from anywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnYA2qIlPCQ&t=70s)*

Like everyone else, I don’t like any of today’s note-taking apps. Like everyone else, I’ve tried dozens of them—[Apple Notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSM3w1v-A_Y), [Google Keep™](https://open.spotify.com/track/1DMD3NZLiTXb9QSPbA4VU1?si=b79d6e906e444339), [Evernote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UVNT4wvIGY), Notion, Obsidian, [Roam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rId6PKlDXeU), Bear, rogue .txt files files, Moleskin, [3M](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/v100800082/), MS Paint—and have never found one that’s not missing some critical feature or doesn’t have some fatal design flaw. And so, [like everyone else](https://benn.substack.com/i/119475953/universal-need-individual-preference), I have an idea for how to make a note-taking app that’s actually right, and [finally fixes this problem for good](https://xkcd.com/927/).

Alas. Because, and I cannot stress this enough, [I am not an engineer](https://benn.substack.com/i/145169149/benngineering). I cannot build real products. Sure, I can write *scripts*: Crude functions of nested if statements and [hardcoded loops](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CbJ_U_sNUo0JoAaVr1_WS2DtNY6oWslXt8UgKH9VD4M/edit#slide=id.g2c84b36ca22_0_2799) that I manually run from a terminal or in a loose Python notebook somewhere. But I cannot do the work that makes an engineer an Engineer. I do not understand classes or methods or callbacks. I have no idea what `__init__` does. It took me many hours to get [ten lines of raw HTML](https://benn.website/) on the internet. Though I hear they are important, I have never written a “test.” In the back of a closet, there is an old laptop of mine, bricked and thrown away because it is still stuck in VIM.

And so, my idea has stayed in my head, existing only between me and [the occasional Arby’s](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sir-this-is-an-arbys). My notes remain disorganized. My wireframes, unbuilt; my million dollar idea, unrealized. My hero, unmet.

Until last week, when I found myself at Arby’s again:

> “[Speaking of buses](https://www.tiktok.com/@andrewlicout/video/7453898588482014506), there’s a fundamental problem with how people conceptualize notes, and *obviously*, the correct note-taking app would –”
> “Build it.”
> “Yeah, I thought about that, but, start another company? The consumer market is too fragmented and enterprise productivity tools –”
> “No, stop, just build it. Sign up for one of those [AI developer tools](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/a-guide-to-ai-prototyping-for-product) and build it. Don’t explain this to me; explain it to *them*.”[^1]

Fine, I thought. I’ll see what the [hype](https://sacra.com/research/cursor-at-100m-arr/) is [about](https://x.com/antonosika/status/1894455965275062323). I typed up a rough description of what I wanted—a [PRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_requirements_document), in the flimsiest of senses—and dumped it into a couple [VS Code](https://www.cursor.com/) [extensions](https://codeium.com/windsurf) and a [few](https://replit.com/) [chatbots](https://bolt.new/) on [.dev](https://lovable.dev/) [websites](https://v0.dev/). If nothing else, I figured, this will make for good content about how these fads are shoddy slop factories that are [destined](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-snowflake-fails) to [fail](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-dbt-fails). The working title was already written: Turn down the music and [get off my lawn](https://benn.substack.com/p/delirium?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=The%20purple%20people%20I%20most%20associate%20with%20aren%E2%80%99t%20floppy%20goofballs%20with%20infectious%20smiles%20and%20indomitable%20hearts%2C%20but%20the%20purple%20minions%2C%20who%2C%20in%20four%20Facebook%20stickers%2C%20capture%20my%20full%20emotional%20range.). Bah humbug.

That is not what happened.

Within a few minutes of installing Cursor and setting up a handful of developmental studs, I had built a working prototype. Within 24 hours, I not only had a polished app; I was already at the limit of my initial idea, no longer just manufacturing what had been in my head, but trying to come up with new things to manifest. And within 48 hours, I was ruined. The comfortable physics that I thought governed Silicon Valley—that stuff takes time to build; that products need to be designed before they can be created; that computers cannot assume intent or interpolate their way through incomplete ideas—broke, utterly. It all worked too well, too fast.[^2] I was staggered, drunk on the Kool-Aid and high on the [pills](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pilled), unwell and [off-brand](https://benn.substack.com/p/welcome-to-bennventures). I knew that anyone can now build [vibe-coded toys](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/technology/personaltech/vibecoding-ai-software-programming.html); I did not know that people with a basic familiarity with code could go much, much further.

Though it’s hard to benchmark how far I got in two days, this is my best guess: The app is roughly equivalent to what a designer and a couple professional engineers could build in a month or two. Granted, I didn’t build any of the scaffolding that a real company would—proper signup pages, hardened security policies, administrative features, “tests”—but the product expresses its core functionality as completely as any prototype that we showed Mode’s early investors and first customers. In 2013, it took us eight people, nine months, and hundreds of thousands of dollars to build something we could sell, and that was seen as reasonably efficient. Today, that feels possible to do with one person in two days.

Well, with one more caveat. Because I learned a second thing at the end of my two days of [vertigo](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/google-bing-race-to-launch-ai-chatbot-powered-search-engines/673006/): That my idea was terrible.

The entire conceit didn’t work. My long-loved thesis, when rendered on a screen, was catastrophically bad.[^3] I did not want to start a business around my app. I did not want to take notes in my app. I did not want to use my app. I wanted to start over.[^4] Great chefs can come from anywhere, but [not everyone can be a great chef](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnYA2qIlPCQ&t=70s). 

To stylize this whole story, this is what it use to take to test out an idea:

And now, it’s this:

There are two ways to interpret all of this. The first is that it’s great for Silicon Valley, and for startups. They can test quicker, build cheaper, and disrupt better. They can accelerate, and replace the classic “[triple, triple, double, double, double](https://www.battery.com/blog/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/)” climb to $100 million with a “[100x, all at once](https://spearhead.so/cursor-by-anysphere-the-fastest-growing-saas-product-ever/#:~:text=a%20staggering%C2%A09%2C900%25%20year%2Dover%2Dyear%20growth)” wormhole. They can conquer more, faster. As Silicon Valley’s [Book of Proverbs](https://x.com/naval/status/1875297712993964231) says, “AI won’t replace programmers, but rather make it easier for programmers to replace everyone else.”

Undoubtedly, parts of that are true. Speed is already most startups’ [biggest advantage](https://kyleplatt.com/speed-is-the-one-advantage-startups-have); all of this makes that more acute. There will be companies that build with AI and companies that don’t, and those that don’t are dead.

But I’m not sure that’s good for programmers or Silicon Valley. Today, all of those prerequisites for building a product and testing an idea—founding a company, fundraising, hiring, and so on—are annoying speed bumps for engineers and other industry actors. But if you look like a good technologist, the machinery of Silicon Valley—from venture capitalists to incubators to [Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas), which promises to help people start a company in a few clicks—will power you through each one. For a Stanford computer science grad, Sand Hill Road is a red carpet and offices full of eager sherpas. For a restaurateur from Chicago, it is red tape and dismissive gatekeepers. For the former group, their ideas become products. For the latter, they become what ifs and could’ve beens.

In other words, a lot of today’s technology is the levered ideas of *technologists*. It is a [book store](https://www.amazon.com/), run by an engineer from a hedge fund; it is [computerized](https://squareup.com/) cash [registers](https://pos.toasttab.com/), from a [social media founder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey) and [Oracle employees](https://pos.toasttab.com/leadership); it is [fitness classes](https://classpass.com/), built by a Bain consultant and an [MIT grad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/payalkadakia/); it is a note-taking app, built by someone who knows enough Typescript to build a note-taking app. But if these products succeed, it’s often more because of the *technology* than the *idea of the technologist*. It’s not that the idea was bad; it’s that the idea was not the transformational advantage. A fine CAD program beats a drafting table. A fine banking app beats driving to a branch. Even my app beats hand-written note cards. And because people who are technologists *first*, and architects or bankers or writers *second*, are the only people who can lever their ideas with technology, their ideas win.

Moreover, this isn’t just some accidental selection bias; *this is the whole point of Silicon Valley*. Flagship incubators like Y Combinator are built on the thesis that a smart kid with a computer and summer internship at Goldman Sachs can outwit all of American Express. That’s not because the kid understands the needs of payment processors better than people at American Express, or has better ideas than they do; it’s because the kid can build their idea.

But what if anyone can? What if lots of people at American Express can build stuff? What if someone who’s been an architect for twenty years can make the design software they’ve always wanted? What if a veteran investment banker can write a program that automatically generates pitch books? What if a real writer makes a note-taking app? What if software is the levered ideas of *experts*?

Sure, the experts’ ideas might not always be better than ours. Sometimes they might get it wrong, and sometimes the Stanford kid will get it right. But if we begin comparing our ideas to theirs, and pitting the solutions designed by drive-by engineers against those built by a problem’s permanent residents, I suspect that we’ll realize that our ideas are awfully mediocre. We merely adopted the dark; [other people were born in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F157geaXp_w).

Of course, technology has been “democratizing” other industries like this for years. In a world in which making movies is hard and expensive, Hollywood producers look like brilliant artists. In a world in which TikTok makes it possible for anyone to make a movie, the old guard is suddenly [naked and exposed](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528404/quibi-shut-down-cost-subscribers-content-tv-movies-katzenberg-whitman-tiktok-netflix#:~:text=1.%20Nearly%20all%20of%20Quibi%E2%80%99s%20shows%20were%20terrible). Now, we’re doing the same thing to ourselves.[^7]

Well, no, that is all a little bit too extreme. Bolt and v0 aren’t *that* good, and you can’t vibe-code your way to a new payment processor; Cursor is not *that *accessible, and every barista can’t build a new point-of-sale system for their coffee shop. There are gradients to all of this. 

But engineering execution is no longer as important as it once was. When wireframes build themselves, there is a lot less differentiation in better manufacturing. There is only the idea. There is only [taste](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/taste-is-eating-silicon-valley).

David Perell—the “[writing](https://benn.substack.com/p/for-the-brand-i-guess#:~:text=Consider%20David%20Perell,to%20famous%20ends.)” guy—recently said it’s increasingly harder to out-write an LLM. They write as well as most of us do, and are just as clever. The authors who make it, [he argued](https://x.com/david_perell/status/1894143267878703562), will be those whose writing comes from personal experience. When the world is full of big-brained robots built on public data, “proprietary data”—personal experience, domain expertise, what we *know *rather than what we can do—is our only edge.

A lot of software today is built on relatively little proprietary knowledge and personal experience. It is built by people with passing exposures to the problems they’re solving.[^8] It is built by founders who arrive at their ideas via an incubator and a pivot. It is built by [Geoff](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-return-of-the-modern-data-stack#footnote-5-157625068). 

That used to be ok, because our unique talent for technology more than made up for our naiveté elsewhere. Founders could build huge businesses by plowing technology into analog problems, and investors like YC could build huge funds by selecting for whiz kids over world-weary experts. And they could both succeed because technical leverage mattered more than domain-specific taste. 

But I’m not sure that will work for much longer. Just as it’s becoming harder to out-write an LLM, it’s becoming harder to out-develop one too. And if experts can prompt their way to a product just as easily as those of us in Silicon Valley can, what winning talent are we left with?

People in Silicon Valley pay for chatbots to do the emotional labor of humoring them about their dumb startup ideas.

[^2]: Ok, not entirely. A lot of them were actually pretty clunky. Products like v0 and Replit tried to do too much, and the hosted app that they were building was constantly breaking and hard to debug. Cursor was much better, mostly because it just wrote code in a local environment. That made development loops much faster and far more tactile.

[^7]: That’s the danger of democratizing technology, I suppose. If you build it, you can’t be sure that you’re the one who’s going to get elected.

*[The decider.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikMKJwbMQ_M&t=132s)*

If you are an 11-year-old fifth grader writing a book report, you spend a lot of time thinking about fonts. The right font makes you look smart. The right font sets the mood—[Papyrus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhlJNJopOQ) for a report on ancient Egypt; [Lucida](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/lucida-calligraphy) for Hernán Cortés; [Copperplate Gothic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/copperplate-gothic) for Edgar Allen Poe; [Stencil](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/stencil) for World War II. The right font (and the right [plastic cover](https://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Linen-Report-Letter-50443/dp/B000WXBE8W/ref=asc_df_B000WXBE8W)) is how you get extra credit. So when you open up Microsoft Word to write your report, you think very carefully about the font, because it is very important to get it right.[^1] 

On the other hand, if you are an AI company, or a venture capitalist who invests in AI companies, you do not think very hard about fonts. You are doing important and challenging things that take all of your attention and energy. You read technical papers and solve the hard math problems at the sharp edge of computer science. You do not have time for trivial aesthetic dilettantes; fonts are frivolous distractions; they are tinsel for children; they are opiates for the unoccupied brain. So your website is simple: A plain white page that uses a safe default like [Inter](https://eurekalabs.ai/), or one of the [original Windows fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1#Windows_3.1) like [Courier New](https://thinkingmachines.ai/), or, if you are engaged in especially serious work, does not even [specify](https://nfdg.com/) a [font](https://ssi.inc/) at [all](https://www.conviction.com/).[^2] 

Ah, hahaha, no, that’s not true. We all care about the fonts that we use, because fonts are brand, and brand is identity. The font on our website, or the look of our adult book report [Powerpoint busywork](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/federal-workers-email.html) tells a story, even if that story is, “I want you to think I do not care about this.” The absence of a choice is itself a choice—a statement, even. There is no true neutral.

When you build anything on the internet, like a website or a software product, you have to make tons of choices like this. You have to pick the fonts. You have to decide what the buttons look like—should they have rounded corners? How do they animate when you click on them? Should they use words or icons? You [have to decide](https://x.com/leggett/status/1555426390765293568) on background colors, and border colors, and highlight colors, and hover colors. You have to decide on padding and margins and how much space to add between lines of text.

You have to make a lot of bigger decisions too. Do you put the menu at the top of the page or on the side? Do you open things in modals or in new pages? Do you automatically save people’s updates, or do you ask them to do it manually? Do you organize things with tags or folders? Can you create nested folders? When people search for stuff, how should the results get ordered?

Most of the time, you don’t care *that* much about this stuff. Nobody builds a new app because they want to make Salesforce with prettier fonts, or because they want Google Sheets with the formatting ribbon on the side.[^3] People build new products because they have some novel innovation—[Salesforce with AI](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-return-of-the-modern-data-stack#:~:text=And%20we%E2%80%99ve%20all%20quietly%20quit%20on%20our%20warehouse%2Dnative%20CRMs%2C%20and%20are%20loudly%20pivoting%20into%20AI%2Dnative%20CRMs.), or Google Sheets [with interactive dashboards](https://equals.com/), or Evernote [with some bizarro twist](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-end-of-yc#:~:text=The%20entire%20conceit,great%20chef.). All these other details are just necessary scaffolding.

Necessary, and time-consuming. Because, even if you don’t care about this stuff, you have to make decisions about it.

There’s this common bit that people use when they’re teaching kids how to use computers. They tell the kid to give them instructions about [how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-6N3bLgYyQ), and say that they will follow the instructions exactly. “Put jelly on the bread,” the kid says. The teacher puts the jar of jelly on the bagged loaf of bread. “Nooo, open the jelly first!” The teacher smashes the jar open on the counter.

The point is that computers follow precise instructions. Which is great—that’s why they can fly rockets and run stock markets[^4]—but it’s also exhausting. Because, in addition to making them pedantic chefs, it makes them demanding designers. All of the necessary decisions that go into making something have to be specified. Even if you don’t care about the particular color of your app’s background, you have to choose the exact shade. When you want to add a picture to a webpage, you have to choose exactly how big to make it, and the exact number of pixels to put in the margins around it. If you don’t tell the computer precisely how to make a button, the button won’t exist.

Of course, there are shortcuts—unstyled HTML; pre-made design frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/); picking a website you like and literally copying every color—but they’re only partial shortcuts. First, you can’t offload every decision, because there is no Bootstrap for choosing between modals or pages, or deciding if your app will use folders or tags. If you want to organize the notes in your bizarro note-taking app, you have to decide how to organize them.

Second, the defaults are boring! Things like Bootstrap are generic fads.[^5] And, though we *can *fully embrace the stock settings of raw HTML, that is both a severe choice—to [pretend to exist beyond fashion](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/03/226213/elizabeth-holmes-black-turtleneck-suit-steve-jobs-style#:~:text=I%20probably%20have%20150%20of%20these.%20%5BIt%27s%5D%20my%20uniform.%20It%20makes%20it%20easy%2C%20because%20every%20day%20you%20put%20on%20the%20same%20thing%20and%20don%27t%20have%20to%20think%20about%20it%E2%80%94one%20less%20thing%20in%20your%20life.%20All%20my%20focus%20is%20on%20the%20work.%20I%20take%20it%20so%20seriously%3B%20I%27m%20sure%20that%20translates%20into%20how%20I%20dress)—and hard to maintain.

And so, we fiddle. We think about all of this stuff because we have to make some sort of decision, and we want to make a good one. We get distracted, reverting to our 11-year-old selves, scrolling through the font list on Microsoft Word looking for our favorite. We spend time making thousands of mostly insignificant choices—partly because computers require us to define everything in line by tedious line of code, and partly because, when we’re sitting in front of a control panel full of knobs to turn, we can’t help ourselves.[^6]

That’s life, in a way. So much of it is the distracting labor of little decisions. It is having to think about small things of relatively little consequence, because you can’t eat an unchosen meal, wear an unstyled outfit, board an unbooked flight, or categorize your application’s documents with an unspecified organizational unit. And the decision is a often harder than the doing.

AI, we’re told, is coming for software engineers’ jobs. But [most warnings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDL_6A6zB0w) include a [caveat](https://medium.com/@diogofcul/ai-is-replacing-junior-engineers-but-at-what-cost-f11099851388), of sorts: It’s coming for *junior* engineers. The robots are good enough to do the mechanical work of translating English instructions into performant code. But they aren’t good enough to make strategic architectural decisions, or see several steps ahead of the mistake they’re about to make. They will [accumulate tech debt](https://x.com/Brycicle77/status/1890117905666412726) faster than they repair it, and engineers need to be their [guiding editor](https://www.cio.com/article/3509174/ai-coding-assistants-wave-goodbye-to-junior-developers.html).

Though this all seems true enough ([for now](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-ben-buchanan.html)), there’s at least one way in which AI coding agents are much more like senior engineers than junior ones: They don't need precise specs. They don't need everything spelled out for them. You can chuck vague requests at Cursor, to add loading animations or to put a button on the bottom of a page, and they do it, with pretty good results. They won’t come up with completely original solutions—their aesthetic is some rough average of everyone else’s style—but that’s often the point. Not everything needs to be innovative; it just needs to work [without being a pixel-perfect copy](https://x.com/umichvoter/status/1700566583104463290) of something specific. You don’t want invention, but an adjustable default: Make it denser; make it look steampunk; make it [sound expensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mY5FNRh0h4&t=32s). You want to be expressive without the painful specificity of layers upon layers of tangled CSS. You want [three words](https://goop.com/style/outfitting-ideas/allison-bornstein-interview), not hex codes and pixel counts.

It also works for more structural changes: “Add nested folders for the notes;” or, “add folders;” or, even, “add a way to organize my bizarro notes.” Though its choices here aren’t groundbreaking either, they are often good enough—good enough to fill the supporting roles that they need to, and, maybe more importantly, good enough to settle our compulsion to tinker.

In [my recent attempt](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-end-of-yc#:~:text=Though%20it%E2%80%99s%20hard,in%20two%20days.) to Build Something, that feature of the experience was as striking as anything. Though [vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) has come to mean “building software without needing to understand code,” there’s a more literal definition that better reflects its real allure: It’s *decision* by vibe. It’s being able to manifest stuff without actually having to choose what you really want. You can tell it your problem and your rough preferences, and it [takes the wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsJB8Top3Tk).

When people wax poetic about vibe coding, I suspect this is what they’re really feeling. Yes, AI breaks through a technical ceiling, but it also frees them from decision fatigue. It lets them think about the things they want to think about, and delegate what they don’t. AI is mechanically useful because it does stuff for us, and that is what we usually talk about. But its emotionally intoxicating power—its real delight, or its real danger—is that it *decides* stuff for us.

Ah. But. Here’s a paradox I think about a lot: Why don’t people use AI to decide what to eat for dinner?

It seems like such an obvious thing. AI—both the vintage machine learning algorithms and today’s generative varietals—are very good at recommending things. People have to decide what to cook or where to go to eat all the time, and they hate doing it. The decision barely matters, and if we make a bad one, we get to try again tomorrow. And yet, most people (I think?) still scroll through Google reviews and cooking apps looking for restaurants and recipes. [As god as my witness, I will not pick the restaurant](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/with-god-as-my-witness-i-will-not-pick-the-restaurant)—but I will not let the computer pick it either. 

So, if you want to build an product that makes decisions for people—or even want to claim that AI can—it seems important to first understand why people are still reluctant to let it make this one?

My best guess is that there are two problems. First, [the recommendation apps](https://whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner.com/) are missing a bunch of enigmatic context—I’m very hungry; I just ate pizza and don’t want it again; I’m in the mood for grilled chicken and a sweet peanut sauce. And second, the choices feel arbitrary. They tell you to make [Japanese curry chicken](https://www.justonecookbook.com/simple-chicken-curry/), or to eat at a random Italian restaurant, and don’t tell you why. Though they ostensibly make a choice for you, they also make it very easy to tell it no. “Pass; I don’t like that; it’s not *[the best](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pKyfV3Ax0sk)*.” These apps aren’t decisions; they’re just more options.

But I think it’s solvable: Have the apps convince us. Tell us *why* we should eat there—it’s not usually crowded on Wednesdays; it’s been saved to your favorites for a while and you still haven’t gone; this review says that they serve ridiculous cocktails in novelty glassware, and we all know how you feel about [ridiculous](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ridiculous-cocktails-in-novelty-glassware/banana.jpg) [cocktails](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ridiculous-cocktails-in-novelty-glassware/moka.jpg) [in](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ridiculous-cocktails-in-novelty-glassware/burrito.jpg) [novelty](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ridiculous-cocktails-in-novelty-glassware/head.jpg) [glassware](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ridiculous-cocktails-in-novelty-glassware/best-cocktail-in-the-world-i-will-die-on-this-hill.jpg). Make me think about what I’m giving up if I swipe left.

The thing is, this is easy? If LLMs are good at anything, it’s [reverse-engineering a persuasive argument](https://benn.substack.com/i/89635026/conclusions-on-demand). That’s kind of their whole thing: Being confident and convincing, about everything, including stuff that they just made up.

Sometimes, that’s bad, and most people who build AI products try to solve it by working really hard to make the robots right. But, outside of a few very important situations—flying rockets and running stock markets and stuff like that—I’m not sure that’s what we actually want. We want decisions. We want to choose a font, and be as confident as the AI that it was right.

There are lots of examples of where this might work. The restaurant recommendation app, that sells us on its suggestions. A dating app that doesn’t try to find marginally better matches, but tells us why this match is worth asking out. A movie recommender that tells us what movie we should watch and why we’ll like it.[^7] Tools for buying gifts and designing your apartment and buying clothes that aren’t just [algorithmic boxes of cottagecore dresses and chambray shirts](https://www.stitchfix.com/), but are apps that tell you why you’d look great in cottagecore dresses and chambray shirts.

And, for the data people here, analytical apps that sell you on their conclusions. There is a small army of text-to-SQL startups that promise a future of instant answers and automatic insights. Most of these companies are hammering away at the technology, trying to get LLMs to conduct more accurate analyses. But this might be pushing on the wrong part of the problem. A better chart won’t convinces us to do things; [more persuasive words will](https://benn.substack.com/p/a-better-way-to-lie-with-statistics). Don’t build text-to-SQL; build text-to-SQL-to-argument, and give an executive the emotional support to make a decision.

After all, we're not really looking for the perfect font, because we never wanted to think about the font in the first place. We're just looking for permission to make a choice, and move on.

# Most graduate degrees in analytics are scams

![American Hustle': Fact Check | TIME.com](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M2Ym!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1b1d193-3cec-4b94-ace0-a3ff9bbd8255_720x480.jpeg)

If data analysts had a mantra, it would be "it depends." Yes, you asked a simple question—how much revenue did we make this quarter? Do people like our new product? Was our [big strategic pivot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don%C4%8Di%C4%87%E2%80%93Anthony_Davis_trade) a good decision?—but I cannot give you a simple answer. Nothing is black and white; there is nuance, texture, gradient. Certainty is for brutes; absolutes are for drunks. The real world is probabilistic; Bayesian; [fundamentally uncertain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle). To ask an analyst about concepts such as "revenue" and "people" and "good" is to ask [Richard Feynman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn_8) about magnets: For us to explain that, we have to start with the big bang, and work forward from there. How much money do we have? Ha. You sweet summer child, we will think. "It depends," we will say.

This is an annoying and counterproductive tic, but in some rough theoretical sense, it's usually correct. The ledger really does have things on both sides. Most decisions don't have easy answers; if a decision is worth debating at all, it probably has legitimate pros and cons. Tradeoffs are annoying, but tradeoffs are often real.[^1]

But not always. Every once in a while, decisions are easy. They might *appear* hard—like they are driven by some complex calculus; that they need to be weighed, considered, measured twice, and [SWOT’ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfB0g_JDIds). But sometimes, they are not. Sometimes, the balance really does tilt one way, and the world really is that simple.[^2]

For the season, here is one such decision: Should you get a master’s degree in analytics?

No. The answer is no.

On the surface, these programs serve a valuable need.[^3] In the late 2000s, the corporate world got enchanted with the promise of big data, data science, and the predictive power of analytical [precogs](https://minorityreport.fandom.com/wiki/Precogs). Data science is “the sexiest job of the 21st century,” [said the ](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)*[Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)*, famously. The people who can do it are “unicorns” and “high priests,” [said the ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/academic-researchers-find-lucrative-work-as-big-data-scientists-1407543088)*[Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/academic-researchers-find-lucrative-work-as-big-data-scientists-1407543088)*. Big data will “transform how we live, work, and think,” said [university professors and editors at the ](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Data-Revolution-Transform-Think/dp/0544227751)*[Economist](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Data-Revolution-Transform-Think/dp/0544227751)*.

But all these grand predictions included the same caveat: There is not enough analytical talent to meet the explosive demand for data scientists. A [quant crunch](https://4906807.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/4906807/BGT-reports/The_Quant_Crunch.pdf) was coming, said IBM. [McKinsey issued](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/big-data-the-next-frontier-for-innovation) the same warning. That was the drumbeat, at the time: Data volumes [are doubling every two years](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-new-philosophers?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=For%20years%2C%20one%20of%20the%20mainstays%20was%20a%20chart%20showing%20how%20data%20volumes%20double%20every%20two%20years.); data science is sexy; there is a looming skill shortage. “Good with numbers? Fascinated by data? The sound you hear is opportunity knocking,” [said the ](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html)*[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html)*.

Reasonably, a bunch of colleges rushed to bridge the gap. In 2007, NC State launched the country’s first [master’s in analytics](https://analytics.ncsu.edu/?page_id=1799#). In 2013, NYU debuted the first [master’s in data science](https://cds.nyu.edu/); a year later, Berkeley rolled out the [first online one](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2024/uc-berkeley-named-1-online-masters-data-science#:~:text=MIDS%2C%20which%20officially,and%20unstructured%20data.). Not to be outdone, UVA created an [entire institute](https://story.datascience.virginia.edu/).

Now, dozens of schools offer similar master’s programs, MOOCs, minors, concentrations, and data-related certificates. [According to a 2021 study](https://www.iacis.org/iis/2021/2_iis_2021_322-333.pdf), over half of the world’s accredited business schools have business analytics or data science degrees; they accounted for 20 percent of these schools’ degree programs, and produced [tens of thousands](https://www.encoura.org/resources/wake-up-call/the-rise-of-data-science-and-data-analytics-programs/) of graduates. If you want to be educated in the lucrative art of data science, there are dozens of colleges ready to help.

Or, more specifically, there are dozens of colleges ready to take your money. Because that is the first thing that has to be said about these programs: They are products, created to turn a profit.

Master’s degrees of all kinds [have always been this way](https://slate.com/business/2021/07/masters-degrees-debt-loans-worth-it.html)—“unregulated cash cows” that universities use to “enroll students at an industrial scale.” Students want to put a fancy school on their resumes, and master’s programs give colleges a way to launder them that right, without sacrificing their academic brands:

> If you’re offering bachelor’s degrees, they all have to be four years long. … You have to publicly publish your acceptance rates, your average SAT scores, so to the extent that you’re selling selectivity, you actually have to back it up with data, whereas in the master’s degree market, you can call almost anything a master’s degree. Master’s degree programs do not have to publish their admission statistics, which creates, I think, an enormous temptation for institutions that have very attractive brand names, that are attractive in no insignificant part because their undergraduate programs are very selective, to open up the floodgates on the master’s side and pay no penalty in the market because people don’t know they’re doing it.

A lot of data science and analytics programs stretch this cynicism even further. One senior university administrator told me that their analytics degree was hastily thrown together in the mid-2010s, not because there was any expertise to teach it, but because there was money to be made by selling it. It was offered by the business school, as it is at most universities, and had next to no association with the math, statistics, or computer science departments. The curriculum, such as there was one, was mostly cobbled together from existing business school classes and technical buzzwords like data mining and natural language processing. It was not an academic program or even a professional degree, but a year-long job fair, full of guest lectures, networking events, and interview training. The program also explicitly targeted international students as recruits, because they were more easily exploited: The degree was sold to them as a gateway to the U.S. job market, and, more cynically, as a way to get a visa.

The degree’s final “capstone project,” which is a [ubiquitous](https://professional-education-gl.mit.edu/mit-applied-data-science-course) feature of these [sorts of programs](https://www.analytics.gatech.edu/curriculum/msa-curriculum),[^4] was an accidental analogy for the entire industry: It has the appearance of practicality and prestige—you build a fraud model for Fidelity! A luggage fee dashboard [for Southwest](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/southwest-airlines-bag-policy-charge-basic-economy-9549218e)!—but it is in fact manufactured busywork. It is not an education or real-world experience; it is a line for a resume, a thing to talk about in a job interview, and a [gold card visa program](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/25/politics/us-gold-card-foreigners-trump/index.html), for [as “little” as $32,000](https://fortune.com/education/information-technology/most-affordable-masters-in-data-science/)—and as much as $129,000.[^5]

Of course, maybe that’s a good deal. Analytical jobs pay well, and most people attend these programs for the job opportunities anyway. The education is incidental, to both school and student.

Conveniently, the schools have done the math for you, and will tell you it’s worth it. The [University of San Diego says](https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/masters-data-analytics-worth-it/) advanced degrees will increase your salary by $15,000 to $25,000 a year; NC State says if you attend their program, [your salary will nearly double](https://analytics.ncsu.edu/?page_id=8975), and you’ll pay back your tuition and your lost earnings in under three years.

I mean, maybe; I’m sure there are success stories. But educators have a habit of [monkeying with these numbers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html), and things like NC State comparing the *median* salary of its incoming students to the *average* salary of its graduates are at least a little suspicious.[^6]

I can also say one thing more definitively: In Silicon Valley, these degrees are often disregarded. Most startups care about academic diplomas as a signaling mechanism—they like that you *got into* MIT and Stanford more than like that you were educated at MIT and Stanford.[^7] They aren’t looking for someone who went to classes for four years; they are trying to figure out[ your IQ](https://x.com/DOGE/status/1857076831104434289).

At best, pay-to-play master’s programs are ignored, and the degrees they offer are looked at as undifferentiated [paper credentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v38lu0Bi0Kk). At worst, they’re viewed as a red flag, the dark mark of someone who proudly fell for a scam.[^8]

Even for less judgmental employers, master’s programs can frequently be seen as lessons that need to be unlearned. Most analytical jobs [are messy](https://benn.substack.com/p/analytics-is-a-mess): They are figuring out how to translate vague questions about things you can’t directly measure into simple math about things that you can measure. They are finding clever proxies for unanswerable questions, and useful facts in the incomprehensible noise of test accounts and [mislabeled UTM parameters](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-design-flaw-at-the-heart-of-every#:~:text=The%20marketing%20funnel,29_len_p%2528fb%2529_gM_.%E2%80%9D). They are [politics](https://wrongbutuseful.substack.com/p/elbows-of-data). They are trying to read the vibes of a scatterplot of 15 customers, and [squinting at wiggles](https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-first-principles/).

A lot of master’s programs implicitly frame the job differently. They teach people how to do hard math on easy data. They teach the academic principles of data visualization. They teach toy problems, stripped of their authentic context.

None of which is *necessarily* bad; better to know the academic foundations than not. But those foundations are not the job, and a lot of startups are reluctant to hire people who think that it might be. And it is a little bit weird to get a degree that will, first and foremost, prompt a lot of employers to ask how much of that degree you’re able to forget.

So what do you do instead? I mean. First, ask someone else, who’s better at [getting](https://benn.substack.com/p/ambition-then-and-now?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=After%20a%20six%2Dmonth%20job%20search%2C%20I%20landed%20my%20first%20offer%20on%20my%20fifty%2Dninth%20application%3A) and [keeping](https://benn.substack.com/p/ambition-then-and-now?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=We%20both%20got%20fired%20from%20our%20startups.) a job than I am.[^9] And second, *do the capstone project yourself*. Find something you’re interested in and a question you want to answer, and answer it.

A big part of the problem with capstone projects is that they’re contrived. They are sandboxes on sample data. The subject is “real,” in that they’re case studies about actual businesses, but the analytical work is not. It is a prolonged interview question that the host company probably plans on throwing away. And it’s better to answer a genuine question about anything—[movies](https://www.statsignificant.com/), politics, the [emotional proclivities](https://benn.substack.com/p/should-we-be-nice-to-chatgpt) of Skynet, whatever is fun, to you—for several reasons:

You always wonder what’s down the other path. What if you went to this school instead of that one? Moved here instead of there? Joined that [one company](https://www.businessinsider.com/15-people-missing-out-on-millions-2014-3), [stayed instead of went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3zqJs7JUCQ), said [yes instead of not now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciWO-DEoA5M)? The road less traveled is tempting; the road untraveled is haunting. What life might we have, down that road?

But sometimes, the path doubles back. You catch a glimpse of it from the one you’re on, and see where you would’ve ended up. 

Back when I was looking for my first tech job, I applied to a few graduate programs that were precursors to today’s analytical master’s degrees. A few years later, I ran into several people who attended those programs at the same time I would’ve. We were all doing the same things: In one case, we were peers on the same team; in another, we had essentially identical jobs at parallel companies. 

And that, I think, is the nicest thing I can say about most of these master’s programs: That, in the end, they do nothing at all.[^11]

[^1]: Of course, most people aren’t asking for the answer in a rough theoretical sense. When we get asked, “What will happen if I trade Luka Dončić for a 32-year-old center [made of balsa wood](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/anthony-davis-player-injuries)?,” the correct answer is not, “In a rough theoretical sense, it depends.” The correct answer is, “[You will get crucified.](https://www.fox4news.com/sports/mavs-fans-chant-fire-nico-during-medieval-times-dinner)”

[^2]: Ibid.

[^3]: In, you know, a rough theoretical sense.

[^4]: Fifteen of the 35 programs [profiled by Fortune](https://fortune.com/education/information-technology/most-affordable-masters-in-data-science/) mention “capstone” projects.

[^5]: In fairness, these programs do offer one genuine benefit: If you are into college sports, and your alma mater [is a perpetual disappointment](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap/_/gameId/401743771), getting a master’s is a socially acceptable way to buy your way into a new fanbase.

[^6]: Probably an honest mistake; it’s not a degree about data or anything.

[^7]: This is rough, and there are obviously exceptions, especially in highly-technical research jobs. But for the general startup population—for analysts, engineers, marketers, and so on—this broadly holds.

[^8]: Also, if you have one of these degrees, that’s fine! The schools are the scammers here, not the students. What’s important, I think, is to be aware of how the degree is perceived.

[^9]: No, really, ask other people. Tech jobs are extraordinarily nepotistic. The good news is that it’s light nepotism: People don't hire their cousins as much as they hire people that their friends introduced them to. Cold outreach to people can be surprisingly effective, so long as the emails are genuine, and ask real, material questions. People love feeling helpful. They do not love coming up with ways to be helpful.

[^10]: This is part of makes a lot of these programs so contemptible. For some international students, master’s degrees like these really are a useful entry into the United States, at a time when those are getting [increasingly rare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_policy_of_the_second_Donald_Trump_administration). But because the programs are often abused by the colleges that provide them, all their students are tarred with the same stigma, even the promising ones.

[^11]: I get that this is terrible analysis, and that I’m taking all sorts of artistic license to make this point in this way. This is what happens when you don’t get a real analytical education.

*[I will sooner lay you into the barren earth than build another elevator.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ)*

In a recent post about how AI is writing more and more code, [Tristan from dbt Labs imagines a nightmare](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/how-ai-will-disrupt-data-engineering):

> Claude 3.7 will write you almost any kind of code you could want. You can absolutely build a pipeline from the ground up, building ingestion, transformation, testing, etc. in Lisp. In Assembly. In the style of Guido van Rossum. Whatever. You could even imagine a world in which you had 1,000 distinct pipelines and every one was written in a different language or framework or set of conventions. All reading from and writing to a shared corpus of tabular data.
> But: just because it is now conceivable to create such a codebase, *is it a good idea?*
> The answer is: no. **Obviously not.** Just as a team of humans would have an impossible task of maintaining such a Frankenstein, the heterogeneity would make it intractable for LLMs as well.

These days, this isn’t a particularly controversial point. Yes, large language models can write code; yes, they can build impressive things in [extraordinarily short amounts of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFxOwNiioT0); yes, it is tempting to chuck a few prompts at Claude or Cursor and [call yourself an engineer](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-end-of-yc#:~:text=Though%20it%E2%80%99s%20hard,in%20two%20days.).

But, we are warned, this is ignorant. AI agents are a fool’s idea of an engineer, and [when you don't know what a profession does, you trivialize it.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43361165) Though what these bots bots build works well at first, they can’t anticipate how a piece of software might evolve. They blithely write code to satisfy the demand of the moment, without leaving space for what might come next. They build a product the way a toddler builds a tower—one haphazard block at a time, until it collapses. According to [one experienced programmer](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43361062), the bots can type, but only an engineer can *think*:

> If I ask the AI to generate 80% of my code without my experienced programmer handholding on every line/few lines, it’s more likely than not hot garbage that takes me longer to fix than writing from scratch. I’ve also generated entire small projects that appear to work, but the underlying code is so poor it’s gonna implode if you keep iterating and adding complexity.

If you’ve built anything with a tool like Cursor, you quickly begin to have the same reaction: It writes an explosively large codebase. When you ask it to add a new feature, it builds it from the ground up, writing hundreds of new lines of code while only deleting a handful. It [constantly repeats itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). It is as though it’s an absent-minded architect who adds a new elevator for every floor in a skyscraper, because it forgot that there are already thirty elevators in the lobby.

The Experienced Programmer would not do this. They would build with components—create a function in one place, and reuse it everywhere; maintain single sources of logical truth; build a shared elevator for the entire building. There is a balance here, of course; sometimes, a bit of light repetition [is more useful](https://gordonc.bearblog.dev/dry-most-over-rated-programming-principle/) than a fancy abstraction that is hard to understand. But that is the reasoning that an engineer is paid to do—to think about what will make the intricate operations of a software product easy to build and maintain.

In other words, AI writes code that is bad. Engineers (can) write code that is good.

But, there is a lot of nuance here, in what it means to be good. And ten years ago, Rich Hickey, who is such an Experienced Programmer that he has a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Hickey), gave a [famous talk about one such nuance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4)—the difference between code that is *simple* and code that is *easy*:

According to Hickey, we often confuse the two ideas. Because frameworks and abstractions are shortcuts that engineers are used to using, they are, to the experienced programmer, familiar. They are easy.

But they aren’t simple. An abstraction is a layer cake of logic; a component that is reused across an application is a lever with many strings attached to it. These are complex things with many moving parts, and eventually, Hickey says, [this complexity will overwhelm all of us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4&t=792s):[^1]

> How many things can you keep in mind at a time? It is a limited number, and it is a very small number. So we can only consider a few things and, when things are intertwined together, we lose the ability to take them in isolation.
> So if every time I think I pull out a new part of the software I need to comprehend, and it is attached to another thing, I have to pull that other thing into my mind because I cannot think about the one without the other. That is the nature of them being intertwined. So every intertwining is adding this burden, and the burden is kind of combinatorial as to the number of things that we can consider. So, fundamentally, this complexity, and by complexity I mean this braiding together of things, is going to limit our ability to understand our systems.

This is the fate of nearly every major engineering project; this is the [seemingly inevitable entropy of modern software engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ). The feature set expands; logic slowly gets intertwined; the strings between different components and classes get twisted and tied together. Updates that happen on one side of an application start to cause unanticipated vibrations on the other side of it. Development slows down. [Every sprint accomplishes less. People spend all their time redoing things that have already been done](https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/SimpleMadeEasy-mostly-text.md#:~:text=It%20will%20kill%20you%20in%20a%20way%20that%20will%20make%20every%20sprint%20accomplish%20less.%20Most%20sprints%20be%20about%20completely%20redoing%20things%20you%20have%20already%20done.%20And%20the%20net%20effect%20is%20you%20are%20not%20moving%20forward%20in%20any%20significant%20way.). Bugs become more common and harder to fix, until you accidentally pre-populate the “amount” field of a wire transfer form [with 15 zeros](https://www.ft.com/content/9921925e-5a32-48cc-a3e3-3f77042477d2), someone doesn’t notice, they try to send a customer $280 but send them [$81 trillion](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/nyregion/citigroup-81-trillion-error.html) instead, which is about $80 trillion more than the amount of money you have, oops, and now you are broke and fired and maybe going to jail. That is the cost of complexity—90 percent of [all the money in the world](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-how-much-money-exists-in-the-entire-world-in-one-chart-2015-12-18).

The only way to avoid this eventual fate, Hickey says, is to keep things as simple as we can for as long as we can. *But there are limits to this too.* Because, while abstractions and components and frameworks add complexity—two buttons calling the same function is a form of logical intertwining, for example—we can’t reason about a million simple things either. We can’t update a million functions that do the same thing, or maintain a different stylesheet for popup. It would be *simpler* to do this—for every function to do exactly one thing; for every element to have its own styles; for every floor to have its own elevator—but we would get overwhelmed again, [by the volume of it all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4&t=1414s):

> The juggling analogy is pretty close [to software engineering]. The average juggler can do three balls. The most amazing juggler in the world can do 9 balls or 12 or something like that. They cannot do 20 or 100. We are all very limited.[^2]

Ultimately, that is the art of the entire endeavor. It is finding the right balance. It is figuring out the right number of elevators to build. It is keeping things simple enough for us to understand them, while using just enough abstraction to save us from having to remember everything—because, we are only human, and we can only keep so much in our head at once.

You can see where this is going.

To borrow Hickey’s language, complexity and volume are both hard for people; neither is near to our abilities. For computers, only complexity is hard. Volume is trivial. Volume is what computers do. Volume isn’t just near to their abilities; it’s their whole thing.

AI agents may or may not be smarter than us, and they may or may not be able to reason about more complex things than we can. But they can unquestionably reason about a larger number of things. They are unquestionably more diligent and more relentless. They are unquestionably better at inhaling millions of words of text and lines of code, and plowing through thousands of repetitive tasks. They are unquestionably better at juggling more balls than we are, and remembering where they put all of the elevators.

Which means they can build more of them. They don’t need to abstract and reuse code—which *adds* complexity—because they can just *duplicate and remember* it. They don’t need to use frameworks to save themselves from their frail memories and feeble muscles. A dedicated function for every button? A CSS class for every element?[^3] A straight line between every artifact and what the application needs it to do? That’s a very simple codebase—too simple, in fact, because it is far too large for us to keep in our heads. But is it too large for *their* heads and inexhaustible hands?[^4]

—

When you use an AI coding tool, you find yourself constantly fighting against its verbose tendencies. “Can you consolidate this into something simpler? Can you look for places where there’s duplicated logic and clean that up? Can you try this change again, but without adding so many new lines of code?” It’s tempting to do this because I’m reading the code it writes, I want that code to make sense to me and to be proximate to my abilities, and when it is not, it is bad code that needs to be fixed.

But is that right? Or is that just me refusing to learn another variation of the same bitter lesson that we’ve been taught over and over again—that computers are at their best when they’re unencumbered by the aesthetic preferences of the human mind? Is fighting Cursor’s enthusiasm for duplication another doomed battle [in the war that we’ve been losing for decades](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html)?

> Researchers always tried to make systems that worked the way the researchers thought their own minds worked—they tried to put that knowledge in their systems—but it proved ultimately counterproductive, and a colossal waste of researcher's time, when, through Moore's law, massive computation became available and a means was found to put it to good use.
> …
> We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning. The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach.

Perhaps we should let the machine write for itself and its abilities. Let it be redudant. Let it ignore the frameworks; let it create explosively large codebases. Let it write 1,000 distinct pipelines in 1,000 distinct languages. Let it be offensively unaesthetic. Let it be radically simple.

I doubt that an untethered AI agent would work exactly this way, or even be particularly close, at least without a different form of handholding. We may have to instruct them to write like this, especially because they’re trained on man-made codebases that prefer some abstraction to absolute simplicity. 

But that could be the irony of AI coding agents: If we can stretch them away from their training data and coax them into writing code that is further from our abilities, they might actually get closer to our ideals.

# The White Lotus Power Rankings

It’s been a real good week for Sritala:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gWX3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa637beff-bae2-4252-a6ff-2ea2785621b9_1004x1278.png)

*WARNING: Light episode four spoilers.*

After episode three, [Sritala was voted](https://benn.substack.com/i/159078612/the-white-lotus-power-rankings) “most likely to be dead.” After episode four—the episode that aired 12 days ago—she plummeted to ninth. (Her husband, I suspect, would not have fared as well.)

Other people on the move: Belinda is rising up the sus ranks—which, yeah, makes sense—but a now-paranoid Greg is falling? And *Tim*, the spiraling drug-addled desperado who literally just stole a gun, is also falling?

Plus, the race for most deplorable is tightening up:

Anyway, vote for episode five (the one that aired five days ago)! By popular demand—and because one of them should be the clear winner in one of the categories—new characters have been added! (But no, not *that *character.)

[Vote!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LS7Kz72pceBEkyc-Z5LrVcW28ZocjX8MpM3SlvfXiTc/preview)

[^1]: [A transcript](https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/SimpleMadeEasy-mostly-text.md), if you prefer.

[^2]: Though Hickey uses this specific analogy to talk about how many folds we can understand in a complex thing, I’d argue that this isn’t really a distinct point. A complex thing is just a bunch of interwoven simple things. If we can’t juggle a complex thing because it requires us to juggle too many simple things, we can’t juggle a bunch of independent simple things either.

[^3]: [Tailwind](https://patrickkarsh.medium.com/tailwind-css-understanding-its-underlying-architecture-3b25fcfeab35), a CSS framework, basically does this, and is very popular because of it. Typically, CSS classes are defined by *element*: There are classes like `.button` and `.error-message`, and font sizes, colors, and borders are defined within each class. Tailwind uses utility classes like `.text-white` for white text, and `.m4` for adding 4 pixel margins. These classes are then added directly to every element. It’s a lot of duplication, because every button will have a list of classes assigned to it. But because each style is explicitly defined directly on the button itself, it’s much simpler than more traditional approaches.Anyway, the whole point of this post is basically to ask, “could we do this for other things too?”

[^4]: I mean, it might be, if we define their heads as the context window of an LLM. But that window will surely get bigger, and more importantly, that’s too crude of a definition of an LLM’s head. In any case, it doesn’t seem at all controversial to say that, compared to a person, an AI engineer has a far greater capacity to reliably update a simple but expansive codebase.

An old friend and I used to have a joke, back when both of us were still working at a startup: “She’s not gonna let us out.”

It was taken from the Perfect Storm, right at the end. (Spoiler alert, but [it’s a twenty year-old movie, so if you don’t know it by now, I don’t know what to tell you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9HWylHQB0g).) Captain George Clooney and his crew have been stuck in the middle of a category five hundred hurricane for the whole movie, and their boat is falling apart. Their radio blew away, their anchor fell off, and they’re running out of supplies. They are losing hope. Then, for a moment, the waters calm and the sun breaks through the clouds. They stare at it; the music lifts; Mark Wahlberg says, “We’re gonna make it.”

But almost immediately, the clouds close again, and the ocean reignites itself. George Clooney says “she’s not gonna let us out,” an enormous rogue wave appears in front of them, they kamikaze halfway up it, [crash, sink, and die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Tdw5nG4dQ).

Between my friend and I, it became a meme:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b_mk!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75bfd22c-781d-4103-850c-dbfd1f578c28_1600x899.png)
*[even less optimistic](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-perfect-storm.png)*

Fill in the second frame with whatever you want: An important hire; a banger of a quarter; “our biggest product release yet.” For a moment, we thought it was going to get easier. The calvary was coming; the boulder was reaching [the top of the hill](https://stvp.stanford.edu/clips/when-the-boulder-rolls-downhill/). But, no. The escape was an illusion, a mirage, the calm in the eye of an eternal hurricane. We weren’t out, but still, always, sailing [towards the storm](https://mode.com/blog/ai-presidential-acceptance-speech#:~:text=spoken%20in%20America.-,Towards%20the%20storm.,-If%20you%27re%20interested).

—

Despite their reputation, startups are not always an especially acute amount of work; twenty-four year-old investment banking analysts regularly [put in more hours](https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/bank-america-jpmorgan-overtime-work-hours-f9f204a7). Nor are startup employees under uniquely extreme stress; medical residents are making life-or-death decisions, not the people running a nascent software business that sells productivity tools to other nascent software businesses. And while fishermen risk life and limb sailing through deadly hurricanes to make enough money to survive, we sit at computers in comfortable offices—or just at home—in hopes of making obscene amounts of money, because making merely embarrassing amounts of money at Google isn’t purposeful enough.

Still, there is one tax that startups impose that other careers largely do not: Uncertainty. Not uncertainty of success—that’s everywhere, and if anything, it’s easier to [fail up](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/15/a16z-andreessen-horowitz-backs-adam-neumann-wework-new-venture-flow-real-estate/) in Silicon Valley than it is in most places—but uncertainty of tenure. There is no scheduled graduation date, no annual offseason, and no two-year analyst cycle. There are milestones, like raising money and moving into new offices and crossing revenue thresholds, but the [old](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-real-work.png) VC [trope](https://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2014/1/22/fundraising-doneand-now-for-the-real-work.html)—”now the real work begins!,” after you close a venture round—is guttingly true: These things are debts.[^1] They are promises to grow into; they are commitments to keep sprinting.

But that’s the paradox of a startup: It *isn’t* forever. They aren’t maintenance projects; they are rarely our last careers. They do, in fact, have a finish line—an acquisition, a graceful transition to becoming the chairman of the board, an opportunity to [spend more time with your family](https://benn.substack.com/p/oops?utm_source=publication-search#footnote-anchor-1-143303690:~:text=Second%2C%20for%20the%20sake%20of%20my%20career%20prospects%20after%20I%20return%20from%20spending%20more%20time%20with%20my%20family%2C), an implosion, bankruptcy, the sweet relief of death.[^2] You just don’t know where it is.

So another friend and I had a different joke: "It'll get better in two weeks."

This week? A lost cause, bulldozed by the current thing—an important deal going sideways; a festering [beef](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVqKByS20Uc) between coworkers; a board presentation; a pileup of calls and Slack messages; whatever. Next week? A traffic jam from this week, of rescheduled meetings and punted follow-ups. But the *next* week? Then, we joked, things would calm down. Then, we will catch up on emails, and errands, and sleep. We will go home, log off, touch grass. In two weeks, the gridlock will clear up, and there will be nothing left but an open road, and a [whole lot of speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-S-PaMWhwI).

It’s a delusion, of course; we knew it was a delusion. That’s not how startups work. Inevitably, the calendar fills itself up again; a different customer has a different crisis; new people start a [new beef](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/beef-season-2-renewal). The ocean reignites itself. We knew the finish line was a mirage on the horizon; it was free beer, [tomorrow](https://www.amazon.com/Free-Beer-Tomorrow-Metal-Sign/dp/B000GBPUPS).

But you need the delusion, because you can’t run a marathon of sprints without convincing yourself that a finish line might be around the next corner. You need to believe that maybe this time *is* different. A new hire is supposed to take over one of your projects. You are finally going to try [Lenny’s Five Tips for Effective Time Management](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/time-management-techniques-that-actually). The board meeting is next week; it’s not like there will be another one right after it. In two weeks, it [really could be over](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/technology/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-crypto-bankruptcy.html#:~:text=In%20less%20than%20a%20week,Commission%20and%20the%20Justice%20Department.). And you can do anything for two weeks. So lie to yourself that that’s all that’s left.

If there is a unique toll that startups take, it’s that: Go fast, forever. Maintain perpetual urgency. Redline, because speed now compounds later.[^3] Sow today, reap later. When? Nobody knows, but keep the faith. The finish line—or the rogue wave—is out there, fast approaching.

—

But if you knew where it was?

What if it wasn’t around an unknown bend, but was stamped on the calendar, in permanent ink? What if your company had a [Death Clock](https://people.com/death-clock-will-predict-when-you-will-die-8789696)? What if you knew that there was an exact day that you were going to nuke your Google drive and your Github, declare bankruptcy—on emails, on technical debt, on actual debt, on all of it—and burn the office to the ground?

It is hard to overstate how profound of an effect that this would have on a startup. “We need to survive, indefinitely” is probably the single most important clause in a company’s constitution; changing it may be the most dramatic switch you can flip. Would you run a startup *that* differently if you never wanted to turn a profit? If you wanted to grow slower? If you wanted to turn a profit as early as possible? If you wanted to work remotely, from nine to five, with [eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, and eight hours for what will](https://guides.loc.gov/this-month-in-business-history/august/national-labor-union-8-hour-work-day#:~:text=Eight%20hours%20for%20work%2C%20eight%20hours%20for%20rest%20and%20eight%20hours%20for%20what%20you%20will.)? These are differences of degree—you’d raise money from foundations rather than venture capitalists, or hire more carefully, or promise less to your customers. But none of this changes a company’s biological imperative: To survive, [above all else](https://benn.substack.com/p/your-companys-values-will-be-used#:~:text=Everyone%20knows%20that%20the%20only%20true%20value%20most%20companies%20have%20is%20to%20survive%20at%20all%20legal%20costs%2C%20and%20maybe%20some%20gently%20illegal%20ones.).

But break that rule, and you change everything.

# Providing context

I joined the Harris for President campaign in July of last year, just as it was becoming the Harris for President campaign.[^4] I applied in late April, trickled through an interview process in May, and then, in June, Joe Biden blew up. I was later told that fifteen minutes into that fateful debate, the campaign watch parties became funerals—heads in hands, desperate texts, people whispering if they should update their resumes. A close race slipped into freefall; the office became a dirge, a living wake for the presumed dead.

By the time I started in July, Biden was out, Kamala was in, and the mood was hopeful. It was [brat summer](https://x.com/charli_xcx/status/1815182384066707861); there were [memes](https://x.com/ryanlong03/status/1808510079382982870); there was [money everywhere](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-fundraising-democrat-president-biden-trump-434a55ea1eb29e5da92cc9b1f9cb401f). We were so back. Though we were never told the precise balance of our internal polls, the rumors were that it was tight. We were within the margin of error, and trending upwards.

I joined the campaign’s data and tech division, a hundred-or-so person department that was run out of downtown Wilmington, Delaware. We worked out of an office called The Mill, and were occasionally referred to as “Mill people” (derogatory). The rest of the campaign, including the romanticized political roles like communications directors, opposition researchers, and senior advisors worked out the Brandywine building, which was best said with a haughty affect and an upturned pinky. True to character, The Mill looked like a startup on a budget, and 🎩 Brandywine 🥂 (derogatory) looked like an Aaron Sorkin set. It was full of posters, split-screen TVs, hustle and bustle, and yelling. We had [a couple loose Kamala signs](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-mill.jpg) and a mouse problem.

The tech department was split into five or six teams: Pollsters and statisticians, who ran carefully guarded polls that told us [_________](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwUQ_5iV9pY&t=59s); data scientists, who turned these polls into forecasts and support models; paid media analysts; fundraising analysts; and engineers, who built our internal tools and [kept our infrastructure alive](https://benn.substack.com/p/no-better-room?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=We%20had%20plans,room%20by%20itself.).

I was an analyst on the targeting team. Our job was to aggregate every measure of the campaign’s voter outreach operations—every ad, every text, every door knock—into a giant panorama of “contact.” We ran an ad during an Eagles game, but who saw it? Which voters did that ad reach? We tried to make an educated guess. Cross our ad buys with the demographics of the media markets they were run in and with the assumed audiences of each program, compute the likelihood that a voter was watching when it aired, and roll it all up, by state, by race, by age, by education, by county. Campaign leaders built a strategy around who they thought we should be talking to—from instinct, from polling, from experience; I don’t know, that was a mile above my pay grade—and our job was to tell them who we thought were actually reaching.

Well, rather, it was *someone’s *job to tell them. It was not my job. Because that is one of the defining cultural features of a campaign: There is an strict hierarchy and reporting chain. Every request was filtered through layers of delegation. Your work goes up a level, then another, then another. It gets discussed, questioned, “decision-ed.” If something needs to change, feedback caroms back down, through Brandywine, across the courtyard between it and us, until it Plinkos its way to the desks of the right Mill people.

For those of us who had come to the campaign from other careers, this was all very weird. Yes, campaigns have to move quickly, and maintaining a militaristic chain of command probably helps keep the organization deft and responsive. But speed is [also critical to startups](https://review.firstround.com/speed-as-a-habit/), and they rarely operate this way. And yes, everyone, from journalists to Republican operatives to international spies, is trying to pry and hack information out campaigns; keeping people in airlocked need-to-know compartments minimizes what might leak. Most internal chatter wasn’t guarded that carefully though,[^5] and we mingled about in an open office.

Instead, it seemed, this was the culture because of something more fundamental: Campaigns are like this because *campaigns are short*.

At a normal company, you have to invest in employees. You want them to build organizational context; you want them to cultivate cross-departmental relationships. You want them to stretch, to grow, to be more valuable next year than they are this year. They are investments that you want to retain. Managers almost always have some simmering anxiety about their employees’ happiness. Are they satisfied? Are they getting tired of their job, or impatient about their prospects for a promotion? Are they about to leave?

None of this matters on a campaign, especially during its final few months. People don't leave. They do need to be developed or retained; nobody gets promoted. There is no next year. The messiness of team-building—of coaching and career development; of cultivating talent; of helping people build lasting organizational awareness; of balancing autonomy with delegation—is almost entirely unnecessary.[^6]

On one hand, this can be suffocating. On the other hand, it’s enormously freeing. Usually, things like “high-level strategy” and “people and morale management” go together; you cannot do one without the other. Though startup founders often try to offload or ignore one—they fancy themselves as product visionaries or technical geniuses who can’t be distracted by one-on-ones or internal disagreements or listening—this gambit rarely works. Running a company requires both doing stuff *and* keeping people around who can help do it.

But on a campaign, it’s mostly just doing stuff.[^7] Obviously, you need to work together, and be a team, and all of that,[^8] but that team did not need to last. Our only priority was to build a machine that [earned us as many votes as possible on November 5th](https://benn.substack.com/p/no-better-room?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=As%20the%20veterans%20say%2C%20our%20most%20important%20job%20is%20to%20earn%20more%20votes%3B%20everything%20else%20is%20a%20distant%20second). It didn’t matter what happened to us on November 6th.[^9]

# Not like us

This was just one of the many ways that the existence of E-day—election day, erasure day, extermination day—rewires everything about a campaign. When I first joined it, I thought it would be like a bizarro startup: It raised billions of dollars; it grew from a few employees to more than a thousand, in under two years. A campaign is just a startup with the dial turned to eleven, right?

It was not—not because of the “product” we were “selling,” or the nature of our funding, or the mission we were pursuing. It was something entirely different, and that difference overwhelmingly came from one thing: The looming guillotine we were working under.

Which startups can only learn so many lessons from. An irrevocable expiration date is effective because it is irrevocable; you can’t fake it. A stern look and saying, “No, this time the deadline is *really *important” is not the same thing.

Yet, the effect was profound enough—not always good, exactly, but powerful—that it’s hard not to wonder what a company would be like if [it stuck a time bomb to itself](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/time-boxed-startup).

—

They say that strategy [is choosing what not to do](https://x.com/MichaelEPorter/status/1064933946021068801). True or not, it’s a useful proverb, because companies love nothing more than not choosing what not to do. They want to experiment, optimize, tweak, reorg, test, launch a tiger team, give themselves a way out. It’s not exactly indecision so much as it’s [maintaining optionality](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-best-decision-is-one?utm_source=publication-search).

But there’s no point in maintaining optionality if you know you won’t have time to exercise the option.

“Disagree and commit” is another popular corporate cliché that’s hard to live. Commit for how long? What if it starts to come apart? When do we reconsider? When do we reprioritize our ruthlessly ranked priorities? When can I disagree again? The possibility of eventually decommitting makes a truly unwavering commitment almost impossible. If you know when the company shuts down, all these questions have easy answers: Commit forever; we don’t have time to reconsider; you can’t disagree again.

—

Is [hysterical strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterical_strength)—mothers hulking cars off their children, essentially—real? I don’t know.

Is hysterical *urgency *real? I don’t know either, but I do know that when I started working on the campaign, I thought I was doing things quickly. An executive needed a new report; sure, I’ll get it to you by the end of the day. We need to rebuild this corner of our targeting infrastructure; two days, tops.

Ahaha, no. Deadlines on campaigns are measured in minutes and hours. Canvasser packets are getting printed in three hours; the campaign manager is expecting an updated Google Sheet in two; your boss needs it in 45 minutes. I thought the job was to [move fast with stable infra](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/zuckerberg-move-fast-and-break-things-isnt-how-we-operate-anymore/); the actual job was to move fast, tech debt be damned. It was YOLO—You Only Live One more month, and is it really debt if you’re going to delete the whole codebase before the bill is due?

You think startups move fast? You have no idea how fast you can actually go. Campaigns ship at a pace that startups can only dream about. Every day is hack day. Every day is launch day. It’s after midnight; failing tests don’t count after midnight. It’s after midnight; fuck it, I’m casting everything to a string.

Again, this can’t exactly be faked. If you want to build a lasting company, you can’t bulldoze tests and hardcode dates. But necessity—and knowing that whatever heinous hack you do only needs to run for three more weeks—is the mother of a lot of invention and creativity.[^10] When you’re racing to finish something that might eventually make its way to the Vice President of the United States, you realize that your old idea of going as fast as you can really meant going [as fast as you thought was reasonable and comfortable](https://x.com/thenanyu/status/1894008538545954909).

—

At a startup, late nights can percolate into toxic resentments. Have one all-nighter, sure, it happens. Have two, and people start to point fingers. Who's fault is this? What process broke; which executive isn't looking out for us? Even if you aren't the target, you can feel the frustration: People want to go home, and tomorrow, things better get fixed.

On a campaign, the vibe is different. This is all going to be over in two months, and holding a symposium of retros on how to fix a process will be more work than just plowing through it. We're here, [trapped in the belly of this horrible machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGKc3T7OVHE&t=73s), and we might as well make the most of it. We are all waiting for a massive data pipeline to run at 1am; might as well put the Airflow DAGs on an 80-inch TV and bet on when each job will finish.

Could we have done more to get people home earlier? Could meetings have been more aggressively streamlined? Could we have been more mechanically productive, turned more meetings into emails, and squeezed more slack out of our days? Probably. But there is overhead to this; vigilance requires energy too. Always asking, “How could this be better?” is not free. And if you know time is short, there’s often [more serenity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer)—and outright productivity—in accepting that some things that *could* be changed simply aren’t worth changing.

—

Most obviously, a death date makes a hard job much, *much* easier. To keep the operational machinery of the campaign running, we were at the Mill, all the time. By September, Saturday had been officially annexed as an in-office workday.[^11] One coworker routinely joked that his goal was to be out of the office by 11 pm; he rarely made it.

It was a lot—easily as time-consuming as any sprint in Silicon Valley, and sustained for far longer. But you never had to wonder where the finish line was, or if this break in the clouds would last. You never had to lie to yourself about holding on for two more weeks. You knew: It will be over in 84 days. In 9 days. It will be over tomorrow. You really can do anything for two weeks, or even 84 days, if you know that there’s no hope that you’ll only have to do it for 83 days, and no chance you might have to do it for 85. Uncertainty, it turns out, wears you down much faster than effort.

# This is water

There is one more thing.

It is so easy to become obsessed with “forever.” Companies endure, or they’re a failure. Relationships last ‘til death do them part, or they’re a disappointment. Legacies are so often defined by how long something lasts; by whether or not they “make it.”

The campaign was [not asking us for a lifetime, just for a minute or a night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep09dej2ABw&t=104s). And to start on something that you know will end is to be liberated from worrying if it will work. Don’t overthink it. Don’t wonder if there is a better decision out there, or if this is “the one.” It is over, on exactly November 5th. They are leaving, soon. Live in the cherished moment, recklessly.

Of course, we all know this cheesy lesson: Carpe diem; live like there’s no tomorrow; you only know [what you have when it’s gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBumgq5yVrA). It’s the sort of cheap wisdom that is in every beach read about [teenagers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fault_in_Our_Stars) with [terminal cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Sister%27s_Keeper_(novel))—not exactly profound stuff.

But it is hard to see how captured we are by the imperative to survive—how held we are by its gravity—until you live on a timeline in which there isn’t one. Worrying about the future is so natural and so ubiquitous that it [hides in plain sight](https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/), paralyzing us, making us cautious, and overweights every decision. We ask ourselves if something is safe. We wonder if this is good enough for “forever.” We rationalize that it’s not. We look for faults and flaws and signs of danger, because one bad choice could have lifelong consequences.

Lifelong means something different under a catastrophic wave. Shallow platitudes find a new depth beneath a pounding surf. That is the subtle tyranny of our untimed mortality: We are blind to the wisdom of these clichés, and the mistakes we make by ignoring them, because you can’t [live like you’re dying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TShlMkQnc) until you’ve lived *knowing* you’re dying.

[^1]: One way to look at raising money is that a VC check is a prize to keep playing a game that you’re doing well in, like finding a bunch of extra lives in a video game. Another way to look at it as a huge slug of debt, collateralized by your job, with a tacit APR of about 250 percent. If you walked into Chase, asked for a $10 million dollar loan, and they said “sure, here, now you owe us $25 million in a year,” you wouldn’t have a party; you’d have a panic attack.

[^3]: Not only is it important for a startup to go fast; it’s also important for a startup to go fast *now*. It’s two extra derivatives of urgency: Running a mile today is worth a dollar. Running two miles is worth three dollars. But two miles *tomorrow* is only 50 cents. And one mile tomorrow is worthless; you might as well not even bother.

[^5]: It was very secure; it was on [Signal](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/25/us/trump-hegseth-war-plans-leak-signal).

[^6]: Admittedly, there’s also another dynamic here. If your career is campaign work, “promotions” typically happen across election cycles. You work as an analyst in 2024, your ambition is to be a lead or director in 2028, and an executive or special advisor in 2032. But there’s only one big campaign at a time, and only a few of these seats on each campaign. Though everyone’s first incentive is to win the election—both because I think most people’s motivations are honest, and because winning is good for your career—their second incentive is to position themselves well for the next election. Your coworkers around you are your coworkers, but they are also your most direct competition. Maintaining organizational hierarchy helps protect your position on the totem pole. It’s not cutthroat, per se—again, I think people are largely well-intentioned—but it is a dynamic that doesn’t exist in the corporate world, because there are lots of other places you can work. There are many other totem poles.In other words, on campaigns, there can be a lot more personal incentive to manage up than down, especially when compared to jobs elsewhere.

[^7]: And it’s pretty fun?

[^8]: But, [you know](https://benn.substack.com/p/delirium?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=That%20vibe%2C%20if,full%20emotional%20range.).

[^9]: Obviously, what happened on November 6th, and in the months after that, has, [uh](https://benn.substack.com/p/good-lord), mattered a lot. In that sense, campaigns clearly have longer and louder echoes than most companies. The point here is the work of building and working for a campaign has a tight expiration date, not that campaigns cease to matter the day after election.

[^10]: For example, in our efforts to mash together data on our ad buys, we had to orchestrate a number of large data pipelines with a somewhat complicated series of triggers. One proposed solution: What if, instead of building an orchestration algorithm, we just figured out all the dates it needed to run, wrote them down, and had the pipeline run off of a hardcoded list?

[^11]: There was some debate about what to call this extra workday. Did the week now have two Tuesdays? Two Wednesdays and no Sunday? Someone settled on the week having six Thursdays—a day you’re tired, but still have a ways to go—and one Sunday.

It turns out, [the corrected table](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/week-4-oops.png) would’ve shown that Tim had actually moved up to the top spot. Apparently, every day is hack day here at benn dot substack dot com too.
