For most startups, the road to hell is paved with predictable problems. They create a product that nobody wants; the market they serve is too small; they chase a vision they can’t fulfill; they waste money running ineffective marketing campaigns and building unused features; they fail to execute, sputter along and flame out, and eventually wind the whole thing down or disappear inside of some disappointing acquisition.

Some companies, however, die more interesting deaths. They beat the usual demons—unrequited product-market love, underwhelming demand, poor product adoption, general mismanagement—and lose their fortunes for more exotic reasons. The product *just* [misses the mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace); the market [collapses underneath them](https://www.clubhouse.com/); the economics [never add up](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/26/on-demand-food-startup-sprig-is-shutting-down-today/); the business [fully detaches itself from reality](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/17/wework-ipo-filing-strangest-and-most-alarming-things.html). These are the startups that build a war chest and a lead in the market, and, because of some [unforced error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLtJgKqups) or [unforeseen obstacle](https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/24042263/how-jean-van-de-velde-threw-away-open-championship-carnoustie-one-most-famous-meltdowns-sports-history), end up losing anyway. They’re the companies that were always going to be business school case study; the only question was if they’d be a winner or a warning. 

In the data industry, no company is more likely to end up in an HBS classroom than dbt Labs.[^1] 

Its unconventional origin story is the stuff of Silicon Vally fan fiction—a startup [begat a consultancy](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/goodbye-rjmetrics-hello-fishtown-analytics/); a consultancy begat an open-source product; an open-source product [begat a software company](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/of-the-community-by-the-community-for-the-community/); a software company [begat a revolution](https://www.businessinsider.com/dbt-data-analysts-andreessen-horowitz-community-following-2022-5). The rest is charmed history. For those of us in the data community, the dbt Slack has become our watering hole; Coalesce, [our pilgrimage](https://benn.substack.com/p/delirium); and dbt itself, not only essential, but [our](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-data-os) [proposed](https://benn.substack.com/p/metrics-layer) [solution](https://benn.substack.com/p/data-contracts) [for](https://benn.substack.com/p/powder-keg) [everything](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-data-config). Given such a golden run, the only data industry story that would be more captivating than one about dbt Labs’ success would be one about its failure. 

Though I don’t think that it’ll happen—just as I don’t think [Snowflake](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-snowflake-fails) or [Fivetran](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-fivetran-fails) will fail—there is some [dark timeline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POT3plx0vBs) out there that ends with a room full of twenty-something MBA students having a snotty debate about how they would’ve saved dbt Labs from its eventual fall from grace. Prior to that discussion, they’ll all read a [case study](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/cases/) that chronicles what went wrong. 

This is my guess as to what it’ll say.[^2] 

# No money, no problems

dbt Labs’ first obstacle was to turn a free thing into money—and in their case, [a whole lot of money](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dbt-labs-raises-222m-in-series-d-funding-at-4-2b-valuation-led-by-altimeter-with-participation-from-databricks-and-snowflake-301489733.html). Popular open-source projects aren’t destined to be commercial successes, and dbt’s [most obvious stumbling block](https://twitter.com/nattyice/status/1573355482953269248) was that it would end up as something we all use but never pay for.

This wasn’t a major issue, for a few reasons. First, dbt Labs expanded their core offering from an open-source package into something that looks [more like a traditional SaaS service](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/rpc). dbt Labs also preempted the possibility dbt being resold by cloud vendors through its [licensing of dbt Server](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/licensing-dbt/).[^3] Second, unlike most open-source software, dbt isn’t primarily used by engineering teams, but data teams that [sit in between engineering teams and business departments](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/we-the-purple-people/) like sales and marketing. These latter groups tend to raise fewer objections about paying for out-of-the-box products than engineering teams (no sales team wants to run an open-source version of Salesforce; no HR team wants to run an open-source version of Workday). Finally, as dbt’s customers evolved from open-source purists and [hacker analysts-turned-analytics engineers](https://benn.substack.com/p/why-do-people-want-to-be-analytics) into enterprise procurement teams, the more compelling its SaaS offering was over a do-it-yourself framework that has to be managed on its own.

Figuring out what* *people should pay *for* was a tougher question. dbt Labs’ original business model was built around selling seats on dbt Cloud, which clearly understated the value that dbt provides. At most companies, everyone who uses data is helped by dbt, but only a handful of people need seats to develop in it. 

Though dbt Labs was initially [successful](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/next-layer-of-the-modern-data-stack/#:~:text=count%20to%20~1800.-,We%206x%E2%80%99ed%20revenue(!),-We%20hosted%207%2C000) in selling seats, it didn’t scale with their ambition. If we assume the average revenue per seat is about $125 dollars a month,[^4] or $1,500 dollars a year, dbt Labs would have had to sell more than 300,000 seats to get to $500 million in revenue—the eventual number required to justify their [2022  fundraising round](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dbt-labs-raises-222m-in-series-d-funding-at-4-2b-valuation-led-by-altimeter-with-participation-from-databricks-and-snowflake-301489733.html).[^5] That’s not an impossible figure, but it would be an awfully steep climb, especially when [other products start offering competitive](https://twitter.com/matsonj/status/1574529855131353088)—and free—development environments. 

That left dbt Labs with two choices: Either compel more people to buy seats, or change the business model. The first path is the slow road to BI, which was [off the table](https://twitter.com/jthandy/status/1469049101421527046). The other option was to bill customers for something other than user licenses. 

Usage-based pricing was the obvious choice, though the optics of this model proved tough. Most metered SaaS products charge seemingly trivial prices for vast amounts of usage—[twenty cents](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/) per million Lambda invocations; [$0.0075](https://www.twilio.com/pricing) per text; [five hundred emails](https://mailchimp.com/pricing/marketing/) or [ten thousand synced records](https://www.fivetran.com/pricing) for a dollar. For the math to work out for dbt Labs, each invocation of `dbt run` would have to cost about 25 cents.[^6] At that price, customers start to flinch at pushing the run button, especially if they are also paying the database to actually execute those runs. 

There were other metering options though, like charging for every call to dbt Server or for every run of every model. Ultimately, dbt Labs settled on the latter option—customers pay each time an individual model gets invoked. This pushed the unit price of each action down to something more psychologically palatable; it scales directly with customer adoption; unlike charging for `dbt run`, it doesn’t encourage people to create teetering monolithic dbt jobs to save costs; it still makes sense in a world where `dbt run` [has less meaning](https://benn.substack.com/p/down-with-the-dag); it meters development and production in a fair way, because small development runs cost a fraction of big production ones.

Sensible as this pricing was, rolling it out caused some angst among a community that was becoming [increasingly cost-conscious](https://twitter.com/jthandy/status/1564359981180264454), and had grown accustomed to using dbt on the cheap. In the end, though, data teams needed the value dbt provides, dbt Labs had the means to capture it, and most of their enterprise customers didn’t balk at paying for it.

# Live by SQL, die by SQL

The long-time headline on dbt Labs’ homepage—”Transform data, transform teams”—captured what dbt had been for the the first six years of its existence: A tool for data transformation. But dbt expanded beyond that—in late 2022, dbt launched a [semantic layer](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-semantic-layer/).

As Simon Späti [wisely pointed out](https://twitter.com/sspaeti/status/1576915531352793089), transformation layers and semantic layers are different things (and dbt had been [supportive of this distinction](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/how-do-you-decide-what-to-model-in-dbt-vs-lookml/#:~:text=Looker%20is%20absolutely%20best%2Dsuited%20to%20calculate%20metrics.)). When data is transformed, it’s typically prepared ahead of when it’s needed, on a schedule, in batch—like, say, a nightly job to clean up a messy transactions table into something usable. Semantic layers, by contrast, are a kind of on-the-fly query compiler: You ask for a particular metric or dataset, and the semantic layer figures out the right joins and aggregations to get you what you need. 

On the one hand, dbt expanding into the semantic layer made sense. The line between transformation layers and semantic models, though present, is blurry; as a customer, I’d ideally define both in a single tool where each operation is aware of the other. 

On the other hand, it was a fundamentally broken marriage. 

When dbt was first released, its promise was simple and elegant: It’s SQL, all the way down. We can build pipelines query by query and table by table, one predefined building block at a time. The downside of this approach is that there’s no true relational model inside of dbt. There is a lineage graph that shows how tables are derived, but not an [entity-relationship diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model) that defines how those tables are related to one another. Each is largely independent of the other.

Though dbt’s first semantic element—[metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/metrics)—could get by without a complete model underneath it, metrics gave dbt’s user base a [semantic cookie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You_Give_a_Mouse_a_Cookie). Inevitably, people started asking for more. They wanted to [define joins](https://pedram.substack.com/p/what-is-the-metrics-layer#:~:text=Until%20support%20for%20joins%20arrives%20in%20dbt%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20hard%20to%20see%20any%20value%20in%20an%20isolated%20semantic%20layer.); they wanted [more complex metrics](https://www.thoughtspot.com/blog/the-metrics-layer-has-growing-up-to-do#:~:text=The%20six%20metrics%20classes%C2%A0); they wanted the logic within one metric [to be accessible in another](https://jpmonteiro.substack.com/p/down-the-semantic-rabbit-hole#:~:text=Let%E2%80%99s%20say%20we,counting%20the%20other.). To fulfill these asks, dbt had to add more and more semantic complexity. 

dbt Labs tried to add these capabilities to their SQL-heavy core, but SQL alone [wasn’t able to do it](https://benn.substack.com/p/has-sql-gone-too-far).[^7] Just like every other prior effort to build a semantic model, dbt Labs ended up building a [complex](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/on-demand/building-an-enterprise-semantic-graph) [semantic](https://www.looker.com/platform/data-modeling/) [language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/) of their own. 

This put dbt on its heels. Unlike other the modeling languages that came out at the same time—MetricFlow, Cube, Metriql, Malloy—dbt Labs’ language had to be shoehorned around an existing query- and table-based foundation. That forced some awkward product choices, like an initial reliance on Jinja, which slowed development and customer adoption.

Still, dbt Labs won much of the market.[^8] Thousands of companies were already using dbt, wanted to keep using dbt, and were willing to put up with rough edges to keep doing so. But it weakened dbt’s position as the pacesetter in its categorical box. By pioneering the SQL-based transformation layer, dbt Labs sold to customers with few preexisting expectations. Adding a semantic layer cost dbt Labs that luxury—customers had demands, and dbt struggled to meet them.

# The briar patch

dbt’s semantic also added a new problem: It made dbt opaque. 

One of the underappreciated elements of dbt is how easy it is to follow what it’s doing, especially compared to other data pipeline products. Within a dbt project, SQL queries are run in a sequence to create tables. Each model is declarative and self-contained; you can read it and check the result it produced. If data at the end of a long pipeline looks weird, you can walk backwards through each step to figure out what happened. 

Semantic layers are more of a black box. You configure the layer, and the queries get written for you. This makes incorrect results hard to debug, especially as the layer gets get more complicated. [Python models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/python-models) compound this problem by adding [external](https://twitter.com/gorkemyurt/status/1577886522660954112) and potentially cross-model dependencies. As does Jinja, which dbt uses partly as configuration and partly as a programming language—and it’s [not great at either](https://twitter.com/teej_m/status/1522096738089115648).

From the beginning, dbt projects already had the potential to be [architecturally complex](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/complexity-the-new-analytics-frontier).[^9] The addition of computational complexity on top of that pushed dbt to a breaking point. Done well, a robust transformation layer, connected to a semantic model, augmented by Python, and extendable with something like Jinja would be immensely powerful. But it’s difficult to balance these things correctly. As dbt Labs rolled them out, the initial calibrations were inexact. Customers struggled to manage it, and a lot of dbt projects became briar patches of unparsable Jinja, entangled Python and SQL models, and an incomplete semantic layer. It was then—during countless late nights of analytics engineers debugging *that* nightmare—that the community’s affection for dbt started to fade. 

# Blood in the water

The community was always dbt Labs’ true advantage. It’s an unmatched distribution channel; it’s an enormous audience that evangelizes for [dbt’s beliefs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/about/viewpoint); it’s a legion of users that provide feedback, build integrations and add-ons, and sometimes contribute directly to dbt itself.

It was also protection that scared off a lot of would-be competitors. For a time, companies that were building products that should’ve competed with dbt bent over backwards to explain why they were actually complimentary.[^10] The dbt community was family, and [nobody takes sides against the family](https://youtu.be/jYnRBX2Trtk?t=111).

When things were going well, this, much like an iconic brand, was an unbreachable competitive moat. No matter how good your lipstick is, you’re not going to outsell [Kylie Jenner](https://www.instagram.com/kyliejenner/).

But brands don’t last forever. As dbt expanded into new areas—new markets, new pricing schemes, semantic layers, Python models—it lost some of its sheen. Part of that came from age and fading novelty, part of it from dbt selling to people who were less online and less eager to adopt new technologies, and part of it came from some of the inevitable missteps that come from building new things.

This decay of the community was a slow but fatal disease. At its core, dbt is a relatively thin piece of technology (and an open-source one at that). Given how valuable [dbt’s real estate is](https://benn.substack.com/p/powder-keg) in the modern data stack, any sign of blood from dbt Labs—especially if it comes from a souring community, a chink in dbt Labs’ thickest armor—will attract a lot sharks. 

Some companies took direct swings at dbt Labs—dbt with [smarter scheduling](https://benn.substack.com/p/down-with-the-dag) to save costs; dbt for the enterprise; dbt built [exclusively for Snowflake](https://coalesce.io/). dbt Labs was able to deflect most of this competition; no one, after all, [was better positioned](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-fivetran-fails#:~:text=if%20anyone%27s%20going%20to%20build%20Fivetran%20Plus%2C%20it%E2%80%99ll%20probably%20be%20Fivetran.) to build a better dbt than dbt Labs.

The indirect competition did the real damage. Warehouse vendors, in their effort to be the [backend of everything](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/introducing-unistore/), tried to attract more workloads by building semantic models directly in the database. For example, BigQuery began supporting Malloy natively. Malloy became to SQL what [TypeScript is to JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript): A syntatic semantic superset to raw queries.

Other companies took on dbt by offering a richer modeling layer. Startups like [Modern](https://themoderndatacompany.com/) built products that could create semantic models across a range of data sources (i.e., a multi-database LookML). This technology proved more successful at managing sprawling enterprise data infrastructures than dbt. 

Orchestration tools like Dagster[^11] undercut dbt with development environments explicitly built for creating multi-source, [multi-destination](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/discussions/5073), and polyglot data pipelines. They were able to copy the beloved parts of dbt Core more quickly than dbt Labs was able to add dynamic scheduling, robust support for Python, and the other elements that people wanted in their transformation layer.  

Finally, new startups began to sell against dbt’s complexity. The industry started to debate if it was time for dbt to be unbundled, and if we would be better off separating transformations from semantics, SQL jobs from Python models, and runtimes from schedulers. 

The result was a war on multiple fronts. dbt struggled to build competitive products that went beyond its original version; customers grew frustrated as dbt lagged behind their expectations in those new areas; dbt’s star lost its luster, and new companies started to jab at dbt Labs. The community turned its attention to these tools and technologies, emboldened competitors began taking direct swings, and eventually, dbt Labs got [caught in the corner and died](https://www.cusd80.com/cms/lib/AZ01001175/Centricity/Domain/8750/The%20Death%20of%20Benny%20Paret.pdf). [One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-sun-also-rises-how-alters-new-translation-fares-in-literature#:~:text=One%20generation%20passeth%20away%2C%20and%20another%20generation%20cometh).

# The future

When we see a company that connects with the market as well as dbt Labs has, it’s natural to assume that something must be a mirage. It looks great, but *surely* we’re overlooking something. Surely there is a fault somewhere in their stars.

And so, snarky and cynical people who have [weird](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-snowflake-fails) [ways](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-fivetran-fails) of entertaining themselves cook up indulgent thought experiments to figure out why things might not work out. We concoct exciting and cinematic narratives about failure, and convince ourselves that they’re reasonable.

The actual answer is more obvious: It’s all real. dbt is a beloved product; the industry cherishes it, and will tolerate its flaws and relax hardline feature requirements because dbt makes thousands of people capable of doing things we otherwise couldn’t. Yes, dbt Labs will face its moments of difficulty, but exceptional peaks don’t always come with exceptional valleys. Instead, it will likely have to deal with the same hard things that most growing companies deal with: Rapid expansion causes moments of organizational turmoil; new products don’t always work out; they become an incumbent, and upstarts eat at their edges.

Despite it all, dbt Labs’ unforgettable start probably isn’t a warning, but a precursor to unforgettable future. No matter how many words we write about it, the final story about dbt is [succinct](https://copyblogger.com/ernest-hemingway-top-5-tips-for-writing-well/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSuccinct%E2%80%9D%20is%20one%20of%20the,of%20inspirational%20quotes%20for%20writers.): It’s a damned good product, and it’s [not just pretty to think so](https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sun/quotes/page/5/).

[^1]: For clarity, when I say dbt Labs, I’m referring to [this company](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dbt-labs). When I say dbt, I’m referring to any product that dbt Labs produces, including dbt Core and dbt Cloud.

[^2]: I wrote the rest of this post as though it was written in 2030, describing events that would’ve happened around 2025. How do tenses work if I’m writing that 2022? As you’ll soon find out, I have no idea.

[^3]: The rebranding of Fishtown Analytics into dbt Labs was also a clever maneuver, because it makes clear to the market who owns—if not literally, but spiritually—dbt’s open-source elements. You can google Kafka without finding Confluent, but you can’t google dbt without finding dbt Labs. (In both cases, though, your first results are about [anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy) and [existential dread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka).)

[^4]: The team seat price is [fifty dollars a month](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/). Enterprise seat upcharges are typically [about five times](https://www.salesforce.com/editions-pricing/sales-cloud/) higher than listed prices. I’d also guess that the average enterprise seat is discounted twenty percent, and that half of all sold seats are on enterprise plans. Given those numbers, dbt Labs would collect, on average, about $125 a month per seat.

[^6]: dbt Labs invokes `dbt run` about [400,000 times a year](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/complexity-the-new-analytics-frontier). Given the size of the company and that dbt Labs is probably a heavy user of dbt, I’d guess the economics of metered pricing only add up if a company of that profile pays at least $100,000 a year, or 25 cents per run.

[^7]: As a present-day aside, it’s certainly possible that dbt Labs actually pulls this one off, and figures out a way to define semantic models in something that feels like native SQL. I can’t quite see what that would look like, but that’s the advantage of having an enthusiastic community contributing to the product. If there’s a way, someone will find it.

[^8]: There are two big risks to this. One is that is [Google gets their act together](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-original-purple-people) and spins LookML out as an [independent layer](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/lookers-universal-semantic-model). The second—and much bigger one—is that [standalone metrics layers](https://twitter.com/frasergeorgew/status/1468986410464002053) simply [don’t](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/transformdata_data-conversations-without-the-question-marks-activity-6971158394355265536-3hqu/) [work](https://twitter.com/g_xing/status/1498788148234502144).

[^9]: The road to hell is paved with [unstaffed DAGs](http://essediem.blogspot.com/2010/03/road-to-hell-paved-with-unbought.html).

[^10]: I know at least five examples of this.

[^11]: I have a [small personal investment](https://benn.substack.com/p/disclose-your-angel-investments) in Dagster. Lest you think that motivates me to say Dagster will beat dbt: If Dagster goes [full Figma](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/15/business/adobe-figma-deal.html) *and *takes no more dilution along the way, I’d still have to take a loan to [send a kid to NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/applying-and-planning-for-undergraduate-aid/tuition-and-other-costs/cost-of-attendance.html).

*We love your bear, but we don't want to buy your bear. *

I'm an aNgEl iNvEsToR. 

I started my investing career in public equities—in a grand total of three companies, to be exact. In 2000, as a Christmas present, my grandmother gave me one share of Krispy Kreme right after the company’s IPO. It was a good first investment—the stock rose from $21 to over $50 in three years—but, in some analog version of [forgetting my crypto wallet password](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html), I lost the ceremonial certificate that came with it, and had no way to sell it.[^1] Twelve years later, I bought my second stock: Microsoft shares, as part of their [employee stock purchase plan](https://benn.substack.com/p/case-for-consolidation#:~:text=Shortly%20after%20I%20joined%2C%20however%2C%20we%20were%20acquired%20by%20Microsoft.). Microsoft went to the moon after that, rising from $28 to a high of $343 in ten years. Savvy as ever, I cashed out at $32. In the final move of my day trading career, and in [a manic fever](https://www.tiktok.com/@geosaris/video/6922517427939069190) of FOMO, I [joined the Reddit circus](https://benn.substack.com/p/runaway-train) and bought six shares of GameStop. Twelve hours and a roller coaster ride later, my diamond hands turned to paper, and I sold all of them. Other than that, all I've ever bought is the S&P 500. [Giddy up](https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/12/down-25-is-it-safe-to-invest-in-sp-500-right-now/).

Two years ago, I “diversified” [into data startups](https://benn.substack.com/p/disclose-your-angel-investments). My approach to angel investing was as sophisticated as my strategy for stocks: Everything was going up, it was making people rich, and I wanted to be rich too. Needless to say, I'm [still available on the VC draft board](https://twitter.com/dhaliwas/status/1579490566068637698). 

Proper investors, by contrast, have real theses around what they buy. They have some [particular view of the market](https://amplifypartners.com/why-amplify/); some [contrarian perspective](https://www.amazon.com/Contrarian-Peter-Silicon-Valleys-Pursuit/dp/1984878530); some differentiating sharp edge. They write [credos](https://foundationcapital.com/credo/), and publish [manifestos](https://foundersfund.com/the-future/). They believe in the cloud, or [in AI](https://sarahguo.com/blog/conviction), or [that founders shouldn’t be older than 32](https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-myths-aside-time-is-on-the-side-of-aging-entrepreneurs-1535742861). They don't shotgun cash based on gut or greed; they find [patterns in the numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLLgNi5UmB0) that nobody else sees, and exploit them.[^2] 

Fine. If I had to come up with my own manifesto—if [benn.ventures](http://benn.ventures/) needed a new ethos to [promote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/1580269584258846720)—here’s what I'd go with: Beware of companies that are inspired by internal tools.

# Product-coworker fit

The lifecycle of the typical internal data tool seems to go something like this: The data team has a problem, and nothing in the market solves it exactly the way they want. For example, an ETL tool might be missing an important integration, doesn't load data quickly enough, or can’t mask sensitive data in the way that the company needs. Or a BI tool trips over important stored procedures, or can’t make exactly the visualization that the CEO wants. 

Someone then steps up and says they can build the solution themselves. Often, their motivation isn’t entirely pure; yes, they want to solve the problem, but they also think it’d be a fun project to take on. Everyone loves a hack day, and creating internal tools can feel like all the good parts of software development without the annoying ones. You start from a blank slate with no debt, you know your product will get used, and you can often shortcut the tedious things—deployment, security, testing—that are required for customer-facing products. 

The tool gets built. The tool gets used. It looks like a profound success. Not only did it help the company, but the team found some hole in the public software market and filled it. Its creators start to wonder: did we strike gold? This narrative sounds especially appealing when the new service was created inside of a high-flying startup. Look at the talent of the team that built the tool! Look at the success that the tool helped create!

It’s usually all a mirage. 

There are three fallacies that make internal tools look more promising than they actually are. First, the obvious one—they have a customer base of one. It’s easy to find product market-fit when your market is your coworker sitting right next to you, telling you exactly why the other products they’ve tried don’t work.

Second, internal customers often have no alternative. They’re a captive buyer. Even if they don’t like it—if the builder actually misses the market—people are compelled to use it, because they’ve been told they have to, or to be a good sport and support the team that made it. 

Finally, the need that inspired the tool in the first place is, almost by definition, a rare edge case. Though that could represent an undiscovered opportunity, it’s more likely that it was unaddressed by other tools because nobody else wants it. Does Uber’s [huge investment in mapping technology](https://kepler.gl/) mean that there’s some latent demand for geospatial analysis out there, just waiting for the right product to tap it? Or does it mean that Uber cares about where people are more than anyone else?[^3] In some cases, internal demand and market demand might even be inversely related. The more a company “couldn’t live without” some tool they couldn’t buy, the further their need likely was from the average customer in the market.

# One size fits one

Still, even this undersells the problem. The value of the tool itself is only half of the illusion. The other half—and the more overlooked issue—is distribution. 

As [some VCs will tell you](https://www.yannickoswald.com/post/distribution-distribution-distribution), distribution can make or break a startup.[^4] Companies have to figure out how to get their products in front of buyers, how to show them what it does and why it’s worth paying attention to, and how to deploy it alongside other software and among existing processes, all while navigating the [internal politics of the purchasing organization](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%22Org_charts%22_comic_by_Manu_Cornet.png). This can be a far harder problem than building the technology, especially if the product is part of an interconnected ecosystem of other tools. 

Internal tools can often bully their way through these obstacles. Teams don’t need to market the tool to anyone; they walk over to people’s desks and tell them they have to use it. Nor do internal tools need to support a variety of technical integrations; they just need to work with the company’s current database, or with the existing SaaS services. And internal tools don’t have to sell people on different workflows or new ways to run their teams; they either fit into processes that are already in place, or the top-down decision to build the tool and update a process are made together, where each supports the other.

Take, for example, OKR management software. Suppose, hypothetically, that some team inside Figma built an application for administering and tracking OKRs across the company. If they wanted to spin their platform into a new startup—the team behind Figma’s operational excellence! The secret fuel in Figma’s $20 billion execution engine!—VCs would throw cash at them sight unseen. 

But consider the problem that team solved inside of Figma compared to the one they’d have to solve outside of it. If Figma used Salesforce for tracking sales goals and Github to record engineering issues, the internal tool could not only integrate directly with these products; it could also make assumptions about exactly how they’re configured and used. More importantly, the OKR tool could also be designed around whatever goal-setting method Figma was using. Presumably, part of the reason for building the tool in the first place was to streamline an existing framework that’s already working for Figma. The tool’s “buyers” didn’t have to be sold on the need to define key results in the way the tool encourages, nor did the team that managed Figma’s objectives have to convince other departments to standardize around their particular flavor of OKRs. All of these were either in place, or were mandated as part of the decision to build the tool. 

Outside of Figma's friendly confines, none of this is true. Companies set goals in different ways—[OKRs](https://www.whatmatters.com/resources/google-okr-playbook),[^5] [V2MOMs](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/how-to-create-alignment-within-your-company/), [subversive OKRs](https://twitter.com/benwbear/status/1543056694330003456), [messed-up OKRs](https://twitter.com/bennstancil/status/1337105608571490305)—if they set them at all. Everyone uses different SaaS products as their systems of record, and they use them in different ways. And OKRs can be a contentious topic between teams, with different departments preferring different structures and approaches. Selling into a market like this requires selling a lot more than a single product; it also requires selling a philosophy, a process, and a bunch of counseling sessions to get everyone to agree.[^6] 

# No Snowflake is the same

Because data stacks now have so many components, and because no data team is structured quite the same way, this dynamic exists all over the data ecosystem. Every data product sits at the intersection of a dozen roles, processes, and other technologies. Internal tools are often bespoke bits of tile that fit exactly within the mosaic of each company—a perfect shape for the picture they’re in, but not useful anywhere else. 

Airbnb’s Minerva is a good example of this. It’s a [metrics platform](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/how-airbnb-achieved-metric-consistency-at-scale-f23cc53dea70) at the center of Airbnb’s stack, and [the inspiration for Transform](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/transform-metrics/), a generalized metrics store. Though Minerva is undoubtedly quite useful to Airbnb, much of its value comes from how [tightly coupled it is](https://benn.substack.com/p/minerva-metrics-layer) with Airbnb’s dashboarding suite, data catalogs, A/B testing and ML platforms, and operational tools. Selling Minerva on its own would be like pulling the engine out of a BMW and offering it to people who drive Toyotas. The engine doesn’t work the same without the rest of the car. Case in point: Transform recently [added a BI tool](https://blog.transform.co/all/data-conversations-without-the-question-marks/?utm_campaign=Boost_Post_Website+Visits_Sep+22,+2022,+11:48:56&utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=paid&hsa_acc=510240792&hsa_cam=629477483&hsa_grp=211970293&hsa_ad=211650683&hsa_net=linkedin&hsa_ver=3).

This explains, I think, why the community conversations around data contracts and the data mesh have felt so unmoored. Both proposals are also like car engines—you can’t easily remove them from the context in which they operate. Data contracts, for example, are a political entity as much as a technical one. Even if teams don’t have to agree on what’s in the contracts themselves, they at least have to decide how to [create](https://benn.substack.com/p/data-contracts#footnote-8), [enforce](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/contracts-have-consequences), and [litigate](https://stkbailey.substack.com/p/data-person-attorney-at-law) them. A type of data contract that [works well at one company](https://dataproducts.substack.com/p/an-engineers-guide-to-data-contracts) is anathema to another because of the political realities within the two organizations. What prospers in one environment might be poisonous in another. 

Much like OKRs, both the data mesh and data contracts seem, as a best case, destined to splinter into a hundred different variants, where no company uses them in quite the same way. That makes for very rocky ground for [vendors](https://davidsj.substack.com/p/yet-another-post-on-data-contracts-9f0), which all feel like Figma’s fictional OKR spinoff: Based on small, specific, and highly successful but ultimately inimitable examples.[^7] 

# A better incubator

Of course, not all in-house tools make for bad companies. There are plenty of successful counterexamples, and there will be plenty more. However, relative to their *perceived* value—as measured by how much funding they seem to attract—I think they’re generally overpriced. If there were data on such things, I’d guess that building a popular internal tool at a successful company isn’t the strong signal that it first appears to be.[^8] 

Instead of lurking around the data teams of recently acquired unicorns, venture capitalists should look at consultancies and professional services teams. These organizations work with a much wider range of customers, sometimes build technical [jigs](https://www.homedepot.com/c/ab/what-is-a-woodworking-jig/9ba683603be9fa5395fab901ae9d659c) to help their clients, and have to work with and not around company politics. Products that help consultants—and even better, products that have been proven to work with consultants’ clients—are likely to have far stronger legs than some glittery tool at a Silicon Valley darling. An Indianapolis-based engineer from Monster Data Solutions, LLC may not have the same pedigree as a Facebook VP, but I’d bet they have more battle-tested ideas. But I’m an index fund guy, so I would say that. 

# How Mode fails

The challenge of turning an internal tool into a company hits close to home for me for another reason: I’ve walked that road. Mode was [based on something we built at Yammer and Microsoft](https://benn.substack.com/p/down-with-the-dag#:~:text=Mode%20was%20inspired%20by%20an%20internal%20query%20tool%20that%20I%20used%E2%80%94and%20Josh%2C%20one%20of%20Mode%E2%80%99s%20other%20cofounders%2C%20built%E2%80%94at%20Yammer.), and for years, I saw this as proof that our vision was right. In hindsight, our prior experience acted as blinders that kept us stubbornly on the path that we’d seen work before. 

This both helped and hurt us. On one hand, it committed us to building a cloud-only, SQL-based data product before that was the norm, and the market eventually (and luckily) came around to those standards. On the other hand, the first version of Mode was perfectly designed for teams like the one we’d been on, and was an uncomfortable fit for everyone else. Because of the success of the tool we’d been inspired by, it took us too long to come down from that soapbox. 

Had Mode failed years ago, this would’ve been its cause of death: We misunderstood the market we were building for, made a thing that wasn’t useful to enough people, and ran out of money before we realized that we needed to step out of the shadow of the internal tool we were trying to emulate. Today, our challenges are different, but still [relatively mundane](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-dbt-fails#:~:text=For%20most%20startups%2C%20the%20road%20to%20hell%20is%20paved%20with%20predictable%20problems.): How do we build the right products and attract customers in a [crowded, confusing, and ill-defined consumption layer](https://benn.substack.com/p/business-in-the-back-party-in-the-front)? [If](https://twitter.com/pdrmnvd/status/1573603915945361408) [Mode](https://twitter.com/_abhisivasailam/status/1578451147089928192) [fails](https://twitter.com/pdrmnvd/status/1578460275128168448), its headstone will have the same boring epitaph as hundreds of other startups, including many of today’s data companies—the product missed the market, and someone else hit it.

That’s what makes asking about [Snowflake](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-snowflake-fails), [Fivetran](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-fivetran-fails), and [dbt](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-dbt-fails) more interesting. They were bullseyes, hitting their target so squarely that their success now seems inevitable. The [hater’s guide to data tools](https://twitter.com/oldjacket/status/1578430621873065985) was never meant to be a series of product teardowns or company critiques; it was meant to be a paranoid search for things that [might stop the remarkable music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAWtcYOVbWw) that those three companies are dancing to. For the rest of us, we're still hunting that beat.

[^1]: I did, however, get quarterly shareholder reports for about a decade.

[^2]: Or so they say. In most cases, these “strategies” are more brand than blueprint. They look good to LPs who want to feel like they’re giving their money to smart people, and they get likes on Twitter. But once a pitch comes across investors’ desks, philosophies go out the window—it’s mostly gut, emotion, and the feelings about “pounding on the table.” If a VC gets excited about something, they’ll find a way to shoehorn their market thesis around their investment memo, just as I could with my “strategy” of [copying what the rich people do](https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1215337629513728001).

[^3]: The [aggrieved ex-boyfriends](https://revealnews.org/article/uber-said-it-protects-you-from-spying-security-sources-say-otherwise/#:~:text=Internal%20Uber%20employees%20helped%20ex%2Dboyfriends%20stalk%20their%20ex%2Dgirlfriends) certainly do.

[^4]: The fun thing is you can complete this sentence—“the key to startup success is ___”—with anything you want, google it, and find some random blog post from a self-proclaimed serial entrepreneur or angel investor that makes the case for you. Is distribution the key to a startup’s success? I have no idea, but my Google search saying it was gave me results saying it was.

[^5]: The author of this post is “Google.”

[^6]: It’s telling that a number of startups have [raised a bunch of money](https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/what-can-the-okr-software-sector-tell-us-about-startup-growth-more-generally/) to do exactly this, and the default OKR tracking software is probably still a spreadsheet.

[^7]: My guess is that specific implementations are like a baseball player’s swing: each person has to find what works for them. Right now, at this stage of the conversation, we’re all looking at only a handful of examples and wondering if that’s the right form for us. Kevin Youkilis thinks he found [the secret to being a great hitter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVrzkbGuxuQ). The rest of us think we’d fall down if we tried that. And everyone is right.

[^8]: There’s another more pointed risk with these companies: Their founders are used to being successful. People who build popular internal tools (or create popular open-source projects, or are just internet famous) are accustomed to running downhill. This can amplify the dangerous feeling of “if I build it, they will come” that’s already present in a lot of companies that are inspired by internal tools.

Pass through enough WeWorks, and you’re [bound to be asked](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/business/against-hustle-culture-rise-and-grind-tgim.html), in bold block letters spanning some lobby wall, “What would you do if you knew you could not fail?” Dream big, we're told, without contemplating the nightmare of failure. Imagine what is possible. [Don't look at the trees.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W05FYkqv7hM)

Doubt, however, has its uses. The possibility of failure—of putting in time and effort, only to have success slip through our fingers—reminds us to pursue things that we want *and* that we want to chase. If we pretend we can’t lose, we choose to play the games that have the prizes we want the most, even if we have no interest in the game itself. We become entrepreneurs who want wealth and power, and start companies based on their likelihood of success more than our passion for the problems they could solve. We become social media influencers who hate the grind of creating and posting, but become addicted to the spotlight. We pick careers for where we imagine they could take us, rather than the daily work we have to do to get there. When we become fixated on a destination, the journey is an interchangeable means to an end, a disposable rocket booster that’s only value is to put us into space. 

A far more interesting question we could ask ourselves is, “What would we do if we knew we would fail?” If we knew our company would eventually burn out or fade away, would we still start it? If we knew we’d never be famous, would we still post? If we knew we’d never make partner, would we still join the firm as an associate?[^1] By separating the work from the reward, we can be more honest with ourselves about why we do the things we do. Are we here because we like the job or believe in its intrinsic value, or because we want the payoff?

In its early days, the data community seemed to attract a lot of people in the former camp—they joined the industry and its social circles on the merits of the work and for the friendships it helped forge. They were here because of their interests, not because of their ambitions. Today, as the industry has grown, it attracts people with the latter motivation. They’re chasing cash and clout. Companies are vehicles for their founders’ success.[^2] And communities are merely distribution channels to be tapped. 

Cynically, [I’ve assumed](https://benn.substack.com/p/human-or-vendor) that this is part of the inevitable circle of life. The lion eats the gazelle; capitalism eats the community; we can’t dance forever. But, this past week, I was reminded that the music hasn’t stopped playing yet.

*Oh, and there we were, all in one placea generation lost in spacewith no time left to start again*

After two years as a virtual event, [Coalesce](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/), dbt Labs' annual conference, went analog this week—it was held in-person, face-to-face, in New Orleans.[^3] On the surface, it was an unremarkable show: a few days of talks, vendor-sponsored parties, and gimmicky corporate fun.[^4]

On the inside, however, I can only think of one way to describe it: It felt like being back in college. 

For four days, my entire professional life was all in one place. Walking around the conference venue was like walking through campus on the first week of a new semester: You pass close friends and recent acquaintances. You rekindle once-promising friendships that faded years ago. You finally get to know that person you’ve heard about, but never met. You side-eye petty rivals and old grudges; you meet new people who become fast friends; you meet new people and make plans to stay in touch, but never keep them. Every walk has a nod hello; every room has a familiar face.

Of course, like college, there are also problems. There are cliques; there are exclusive parties; there are obstacles of distance and circumstance that keep worthy people away. But on the whole, in ways I haven’t felt since undergrad, there is true community. This is our school, these are our people, and, despite some periodic controversy or lingering bit of bad blood, there is a shared sense of fellowship that marries us all. 

In prior years, I thought that the invisible force that bound Coalesce together was its attendees’[ good character](https://benn.substack.com/p/delirium). That explanation no longer feels sufficient. The group has gotten too big—there are forty thousand of us in the dbt Slack—and its doors are too wide open for there to be such a meaningful difference between people who come to Coalesce and the general population of professionals from which they come. Something else must make it unique. 

The answer, I think, is the obvious one: It’s dbt Labs. 

In ways big and small, dbt Labs sets a cultural tone of enthusiastic inclusion. The [major release of the conference](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/frontiers-of-the-dbt-semantic-layer/) started as a feature that was [proposed and debated](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/4071) in the open. Talk emcees made every effort to make online viewers first class attendees. Vendors were encouraged to make their booths more than dull demo stations. Organizers elevated talks that [embraced the community’s personality](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/agenda/what-classes-from-roleplaying-games-can-teach-us-about-a-career-in-data) as much as its purchasing power, and sent cheering sections to root them on. With a drum so loud, the rest of us can’t help but follow the beat.

Culture, however, isn’t the only thing setting the tempo. Over the last six years, [amid the building war](https://benn.substack.com/p/powder-keg) in the data ecosystem, dbt Labs has managed to not only be an enemy to none, but an ally to all. This puts other vendors who are competing with one another on their best behavior. In dbt Labs’ demilitarized zone, there’s a strong incentive to play nice, and to work with the community, rather than against your competitors.

The combination of the two has turned Coalesce into one of the last honest gatherings in the data community. As one new analytics engineer put it to me last night, inside of Coalesce and the dbt Slack, she can find and talk to people across a range of roles and experiences. She is welcomed, as are her questions and outreach. Without dbt Labs, all she has is trade shows, sales pitches, and the impossible swirl of Twitter. This isn’t a community, but a broadcast, with talking heads and commercials, and an audience wondering if they’re allowed to participate. 

*And they were singing bye, bye, Miss American PieDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dryThem good old boys were drinking whiskey and ryeSinging, "This'll be the day that I die."*

*This will be the day that I die.*

—

One day, dbt Labs will die. [Not fully, probably](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-dbt-fails), but the company that it is today will die. Just as the size and scale of the data industry corrupted us, the size and scale of dbt Labs will one day corrupt it. As they add more enterprise clients, community-led product development will give way to dollar-driven roadmaps and exclusive advisory boards. As they try to find new revenue streams, they’ll build products that antagonize partners. As their position in the data stack grows more complex, they’ll struggle to remain neutral. If they go public, Wall Street will see the community—and Coalesce along with it—as an asset to monetize.[^5] 

I genuinely don’t know if the eventual evolution of Coalesce can be stopped. [No community lasts forever](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/a-cyclic-theory-of-subcultures), and the business success that makes Coalesce possible today is the same force that will one day compel it to become something different tomorrow. Perhaps dbt Labs eventually spins out a community entity that’s removed from its for-profit core? Perhaps Coalesce picks up “founding” sponsors, and it becomes jointly owned? Perhaps it’s actually easy to keep it exactly as it is, and none of this matters? Regardless of these answers, can we, the generation of data people who’ve reaped the rewards of dbt Labs’ community building, protect it for the next generation?

These are important questions—but questions for another day. For now, as we scatter ourselves back across the world, the best thing to do is simply not take it for granted.  

For the third year in a row, Coalesce gave us a reunion. It gave us a chance to finally meet, to celebrate, to discover, to learn, to bicker, to gossip, to stare down your nemesis, to realize your nemesis isn’t so bad, to reflect, to grow, to regress, to put a personality to an avatar, to put a story to personality, to blow the party budget, to under-prepare, to over-deliver, to give your first talk, to give a talk to the biggest audience of your career, to give a talk to a raucous audience that wants nothing more than your joke to land, to land the joke perfectly, to botch the joke and be forgiven, to skip the dinner you should go to, to crash the dinner you shouldn’t go to, to meet your mentees, to meet your mentors, to realize your mentors’ resumes aren’t so daunting, to know, no matter the problem you have, frustration you’re feeling, or weird thought you’re stuck on, that someone else has been there, is there, and is waiting, just like you, to talk about it.

For as long as that lasts—one more year, three more years, for decades to come—we should be appreciate it while have it. Because even if we could predict the day the music dies—even if we knew, with absolute certainty, that the audacious ambition of Coalesce would “fail”—we should be grateful that dbt Labs did it anyway.

[^1]: When asking myself this question, I’ve found it useful to assume I failed for reasons beyond my control. I obviously wouldn’t take a job if I knew I’d perpetually underperform and slog through the corporate career ladder for years. But would I take the job if I knew, right on the cusp of that big promotion, my company eliminated the position? That’s a much more interesting thought experiment.

[^2]: To be clear, I probably joined it somewhere in the middle of this shift, and for reasons on both sides of the line. I made [weird charts for fun](https://twitter.com/WallOfData); I also started a company to make money and write a blog to shill for likes and follows.

# Data's invisible hand

*An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of data teams.*

*[weird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith#Character)*

Externally, startups are the ultimate capitalist enterprise. They fight in raw competition with no political clout; they benefit from no regulatory capture; they are afforded no unfair advantages. Their survival depends entirely on their ability to win users and customers. Their reward is unimaginable wealth; their punishment is destitution and bankruptcy. The market is the only true meritocracy; may the best company win. 

But internally, startups are the ultimate [collectivist](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-collectivistic-cultures-2794962) enterprise. They urge employees to make personal sacrifices for the greater good; they preach about shared ownership; they promote the needs of the company over individual careerism. They instruct everyone to disagree, but commit. They make decisions by consensus when they’re small, then by executive edict when they’re large. They are values driven; they are a team; they are highly collaborative.

Data teams often live this collectivist ethos. We function as a service organization, built to enable others. We build self-serve tools that try to meet others where they are—[from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs). We take requests from the company and prioritize them, in [artificially quantified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Quadrant) two-by-two [matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfB0g_JDIds) that compare [impact and effort](https://www.sixsigmadaily.com/how-to-use-the-impact-effort-matrix/), to determine how we can best promote the welfare of our corporate society. We are [Project Cybersyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn), sitting in our command center of dashboards and statistics, attempting to figure out what the company needs. 

It’s a stressful and challenging role. We get asked too many questions, and have to decide what to do and what to discard based on incomplete information—[how valuable was that critical dashboard, really?](https://twitter.com/DataGwen/status/1575098830001156097)—and loose heuristics that favor things due today over things due tomorrow, and favor things from executives over things from managers. 

What if, instead, we acted like our companies act, and let the market decide?[^1] What if we built an internal economy for data work so that everyone pursues their own self-interests, and [in doing so](https://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/Details/invisiblehand.html#:~:text=By%20pursuing%20his%20own%20interest%20he%20frequently%20promotes%20that%20of%20the%20society%20more%20effectually%20than%20when%20he%20really%20intends%20to%20promote%20it.), “promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it?”

It’s Friday; let’s invent some wild ideology and see where it takes us.

# Cap and trade

Here’s how an analytical economy might work. Every quarter, everyone at the company is given a set number of credits that they can use to “buy” work from the data team. Each week, or on whatever sprint cadence makes sense, the data team holds an open auction. People submit bids for work. Each bid includes a project proposal and an offer price. During the auction, the data team asks questions, and bidders answer them to fill in missing details about their proposals. The two sides then negotiate: Analysts and data team members choose which projects they want to do, and the bidders haggle over prices to make sure their proposals get chosen. At the end of the whole exercise, rejected proposals get shelved and winning bidders pay up. The data team delivers the work they sold. Next week, everyone does it all over again.

It’s a tidy little economy, and, [as is always true with these miniature markets](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/10/baby-sitting-the-economy.html), has—in theory—a lot of elegant properties.

First and foremost, a bid-and-ask model like this should prioritize work much more efficiently than a data team that makes decisions on their own. Nobody is a better judge of a data asset’s worth [than its consumer](https://hex.tech/blog/data-team-roi/). But today, those consumers communicate that worth by lobbying the data team for their time, meaning the squeaky stakeholders—or the most convincing ones—get the grease.  

Credits level the playing field. People can’t demonstrate the value of their request through an impassioned Slack message; they can’t inflate a project’s urgency or exaggerate its impact. Instead, they can only spend a scarce resource. That’s a much truer signal of value, in both directions—people would only pay high prices for truly important work, and won’t pay much for indulgent curiosities.[^2] 

An open auction doesn’t just create a market for the work itself, however; it also prices in a lot of other intangible tradeoffs that data teams often have to make. Urgency is priced in: If someone needs something immediately, they would pay more for it. On the extreme end, bidders could buy an all-nighter—everyone’s 4 a.m. has a price.[^3] Long-term versus short-term tradeoffs are priced in: Since every project is traded on the same market, buyers can explicitly decide how to value a long-needed revamp to a core dashboard relative to an immediate fix that duct tapes over a problem. Speculation is priced in: People can choose if they want to spend their credits on exploratory research that may come up empty, or if they’d rather buy less risky projects that have a lower ceiling. 

None of this is directly controlled by external stakeholders though; data teams are still autonomous. If they want to focus on a strategic initiative over the rote dashboard updates that people want, they can—they’ll just get paid less to do it. Similarly, desirable work—that fun ML project, launching a new experimentation platform, working with the marketing team on field research—would trade at a discount compared to the interminable Salesforce reconciliation project.[^4] But that’s the beauty of the open market: If something is valuable enough, prices adjust, someone eventually accepts the bid, and [the market clears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_clearing). 

Prices could even account for team dynamics like performance and team organization. Congenial and collaborative stakeholders could buy work at lower prices than rude ones. Good analysts could command higher prices than bad ones, and analysts who are experts in a particular domain could price their work in that area at a premium. If analysts wanted to change their focus—to move from operations work to product, or shift from being an analyst to an analytics engineer—they’d be free to accept bids in those areas; they’d just get paid fewer credits to do so. The same is true for assigning who gets to work on the best projects. Every bid is open to everyone; it’s just a matter of what price you’re willing to take. 

# Hitting quota

There is one blaring question in the center of this whole scheme: Why would members of the data team want to collect credits in the first place? Everyone else can use credits to buy work from the data team. But what good are they if you *are* the data team? If all you can buy with [Schrute bucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPeRElll3Hw) are beets, what are Schrute bucks worth to a beet farmer?

One option, if we wanted to completely reinvent how companies work, is to create the same cap-and-trade schemes for other departments. Need engineering help debugging a data pipeline? Pay in credits. Want design help on a slide deck? Pony up. Trying to schedule a meeting? Buy the time of all the attendees. I have no idea what the implications of this would be, nor do I have the money to spend on a [JSTOR subscription](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3657289) to figure them out. 

The other, much simpler option is that data team members carry credit quotas, much like sales reps and account managers do. Every quarter, members on the team are assigned a quota, with more senior members carrying a higher quota than junior members. People retire their quota by selling their work in the weekly auction. If team members’ earnings exceed their quota, they get paid a cash bonus; if individuals fall short, it’s considered a performance problem. And if the entire team misses their aggregate quota, it’s a performance problem for the team’s leadership.[^5] 

A program like this also offers a third option in the forever war in Silicon Valley [over](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ev3b3p/dont-work-80-hours-a-week-for-elon-musk-or-anyone) [working](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/06/success/jason-fried-basecamp-work/index.html) [hours](https://twitter.com/Dangerman_2/status/1585807441073410050). Data team members would get paid for the projects they deliver, with each of those projects priced at a value set by the market. High performers could close out their quota quickly and in fewer hours; if they want a bigger bonus, they accept more bids, clock in more time, collect more credits, and get paid. Struggling analysts could still beat or exceed their quotas, though they might have to work more hours to earn the same amount.[^6] 

# The economics of the firm

The fun[^7] part of this proposal, however, comes from its corollaries and extensions. Once you have a core market in place—once there are buyers, sellers, and credits that both parties want—a whole bunch of other interesting possibilities start to fall out. 

For example, one implication is that a credit-and-quota economy like this puts an explicit price on analytical work. Companies can use the bonus payout rate to convert credits into cash equivalents; this conversion rate can then be used to figure out the cost of every accepted analytical project. If companies feel that these prices are too high—i.e., if the company is shipping dashboard updates for $10,000 and a few new dbt models for $35,000—they can cool the analytical economy by lowering the number of credits in circulation. Conversely, if projects are underpriced—i.e., the company is spending $500 on strategic research that’s easily worth ten times that—the company can issue more credits. This would stoke demand for analytical work by giving stakeholders more money to spend, and encourage data teams to expand their supply, by working more or by working faster, since they would have a larger bonus pool to chase.[^8] 

Companies could also intervene in more direct ways. Leaders could be given more credits than other people at the company, creating a more structured and transparent [HIPPO effect](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/?sh=2cee63cb80f9). Additionally, teams that are supporting key initiatives, like a marketing organization has a big launch or a finance team that is leading a fundraise, could also get extra credits. These adjustments give leadership some sway over what data teams work on without having to dictate it outright, and without fully freezing everyone else out. Even when there are urgent priorities, anyone can still bid for work; the price is just higher.

There are other wild ideas: Data teams could charge subscription fees to keep their time on retainer, in case unexpected questions come up in the normal course of business. Buyers could pool their credits to create joint proposals. Analysts could pair on projects, and share the revenue. Project proposals could have tiered payouts, where part of the bid is paid upfront, and part is paid on delivery.[^9] Data teams could market their services, and offer discounts on projects that are complementary with one another.[^10] 

I suspect there are countless other extensions and permutations and secondary effects. Some might work; some might be a disaster; some might just be weird. But that’s how we progress: By [letting a hundred flowers bloom, and letting a hundred schools of thought content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign#Naming).[^11]

# Would it actually work?

Admittedly, when I first had this idea, I thought it’d be an interesting thought experiment that hangs a few compelling suggestions off of a fundamentally broken foundation. But now the opposite seems true: It could actually work, if you sand down some rough edges. 

For example, companies would have to create some system of arbitration to resolve the inevitable arguments between a buyer who says they didn’t get what they paid for, and an analyst who says that some detail wasn’t properly specified in the original agreement.[^12] But, to avoid contract disputes, bidders would be incentivized to be transparent about exactly what they want to buy. Do they want a one-off answer, a [self-destructing dashboard](https://counting.substack.com/p/what-if-every-dashboard-self-destructed), or a [production dataset](https://benn.substack.com/p/what-is-production) that needs to be maintained forever? What quality and latency expectations do they have? We already ask these questions in [request intake forms](https://www.caitlinhudon.com/posts/2020/09/16/data-intake-form); tying them to a contractual bid just forces a bit more honesty—and more accountability from the data team to deliver on them.

A free market economy could also turn what should be a collaborative work environment into a cutthroat one, where stakeholders are bidding against one another, data team members are competing against one another, and data teams and stakeholders are negotiating against one another. This already happens though; the fight is just unstructured and underhanded. Projects get prioritized through DMs and executive vetoes. A transparent bidding system in which everyone can see what bids the team accepts and at what cost they accept them may actually create a healthier dynamic than one built on argument and influence.

Still, fully embracing a free-for-all open market *feels* off—if for no other reason than to protect ourselves from removing the guardrails that keep us from periodically [careening us into a ditch](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-much-is-265-billion-dollars#:~:text=While%20we%27re%20here%2C%20I%20do%20have%20one%20final%2C%20brief%20thought%20on%20this%20whole%20circus). As John Maynard Keynes ([never](http://stevecotler.com/tales/2009/07/07/keynes-nastiest-wickedest-capitalism/)) said, “capitalism is the extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work for the benefit of all.” As promising as a free market for analysis might be, [on today of all days](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/28/business/twitter-elon-musk), I’m still voting for a bit more regulation.

[^2]: This is one way to eliminate open-ended wild goose chases. People are much less likely to send data teams down rabbit holes if they’re paying to dig the tunnel.

[^3]: This also encourages buyers to ask for work early. Like booking a plane ticket eighteen hours before takeoff, indecision—or “flexibility” as those of us who routinely buy tickets and check in at the same time prefer to call it—comes at a cost.

[^4]: Another benefit: If data teams charge more for painful projects, stakeholders—or “data producers”—are incentivized to make their data easier to work with. A marketing ops team that keeps Hubspot clean could buy a lot more of the data team’s time than one that leaves Hubspot as a disorganized mess.

[^5]: Team quota attainment is to [team NPS](https://www.secoda.co/blog/net-promoter-score-for-data-teams) as revealed preferences are to stated preferences.

[^6]: One one hand, this definitely feels like a ruthless and impersonal way to resolve impossibly sticky questions about work-life balance (the invisible hand is fair, but it’s not tender). On the other hand, sales teams have operated this way forever, and sales organizations are generally accepting of it as a reasonable way to work and get compensated.

[^7]: Look, I write a weekly blog about databases and ETL tools. My idea about what’s fun has gotten pretty warped at this point.

[^8]: In determining the credits in circulation, the leadership team is, in effect, setting monetary policy. (Twenty-six year old startup founders setting monetary policy; what could go wrong?) Removing credits from the economy would lower prices; if credits have fixed dollar equivalents—for example, if analysts are paid $500 for every credit they collect over their quota—lower prices for analytical services would discourage analysts from offering these services. Adding credits to the economy would have the opposite effect. If analysts could charge more for the same work, production would increase. At least I think this would happen. The fixed conversion rate kind of looks like a [gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard) or a [dollar peg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_exchange_rate_system), in which fiat currencies (credits, in this case) are [convertible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertibility) into something of stable value. These monetary systems normally don’t allow for expansionary monetary policies. However, I don’t think this internal economy would function the same way, because companies can arbitrarily change the conversion rate—i.e., the dollar amount they pay out for each credit—without running the risk of running out of reserves. But they aren’t strictly fiat economies either, since credits can always be converted to some cash equivalent. So I’m not sure how you would best model this. Here’s to hoping I never get bored enough to write *that* blog post.

[^9]: Investigative work could be paid for in this way, to hedge against the risk that the exploration goes nowhere and turns up nothing of value.

[^10]: The bleakest of futures: One analyst runs ads in Slack promoting their services. They buy an [ad attribution study](https://thotleaderlabs.com/products/marketing-attribution-is-fake-news-mug) from another analyst. The data team [eats itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros).

[^11]: Ok, so maybe Mao isn’t the right person to quote in my closing argument for turning data teams into unchecked capitalists. But it’s a good quote.

[^12]: That’s a true data contract: A forty page tome of legalese that lays out, in painful lawyerly detail, exactly how to build a new marketing lead funnel dashboard.

![Below Deck': Andy Cohen Was Frustrated With Shane Coopersmith on 'WWHL'](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HDku!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42568b95-d288-4b55-a0ed-ce8475b2d4d7_1200x800.jpeg)
*[In which we watch famous people do stupid things.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_What_Happens_Live_with_Andy_Cohen)*

In an hour, Harvard Business School changed perspective on the world.

I’ve never been affiliated with Harvard, or with any business school. But a good friend of mine went to HBS, and invited me to drop in to a few of his classes while he was there. To Harvard’s credit, they welcome periodic interlopers like this, albeit with one weird ritual: At the start of each class, I was asked to stand up, my friend introduced me, and the rest of the class applauded. I was never sure if it was meant to honor guests or haze them.

During my visit, I was particularly interested in a session on Dropbox. As was typical for every class, students had been given a [case study](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/Pages/the-hbs-case-method.aspx) that introduced some strategic business problem that needed to be solved. In this instance, the case told a familiar story in Silicon Valley. A team of engineers and designers created an explosively popular product. As the company grew, it faced a choice: Continue to be a product-led organization and protect its “unique” culture that scoffed at traditional sales tactics, advertising programs, and quota-base compensation plans, or hire experienced enterprise leaders who could execute on tried-and-true sales and marketing playbooks. Some factions thought it was time to grow up; others said that Dropbox was different and could blaze a new trail to enduring success.

All of this was quickly outlined in [a case study that breezed through a remarkable amount of material](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/case-studies/dropbox) in only 22 pages. It briefed us on the story of Dropbox's founding, the history of SaaS, the basics of enterprise software, a description of the product Dropbox sold, its benefits, its shortcomings, its viral mechanics and growth strategy, a few equations that explained the economic model of the business, the differences between inbound and outbound sales motions, a survey of the competitive landscape, notes about the company culture, and arguments from different executives about what the company should do next. 

With this—a paragraph on Dropbox’s org structure, three paragraphs on what the cloud is, a sentence on Box, and dozens of other compressed explainers—as our complete preamble, we arrived to class and were immediately asked one question: If you were in charge, what would you do? 

The students, who were graded on how frequently they spoke in class, unloaded from the hip. They rattled off idea after impulsive idea, some plausible, some with potential, some puzzling and some preposterous. But every answer—from the good ones to the ghastly—was proposed with the kind of confidence that's only available to a junior investment banker who's spent his entire life being reassured by his parents and private school teachers that he’s a very smart boy. 

None of this was that surprising. I've also been a smug 25-year-old guy with a resume that I thought had a lot more glitter than it did.[^1] What was surprising, however, was the professor's reaction. After every answer—good, bad, and incoherent—he would nod, furrow his brow a bit, and turn back to the peanut gallery of former McKinsey analysts and associate product managers to ask what they thought of the plan Misters Graham and Murray had just uncorked. In an escalating series of [“yes, and…”’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...), the class hurled its way toward some harebrained catastrophe. 

And then, with our bad ideas still lingering in the air…we left. The future leaders of government and industry were never told which recommendations of theirs were good or bad, what Dropbox actually did, or which ideas might’ve worked out.[^2] They were never told that they were wrong, only that they were interesting. They were never tested, only reaffirmed. They were never challenged, only applauded for just showing up—and they walked out [confident that they were ready to run companies and countries alike](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/blog/post/how-hbs-changed-my-life). Society, it seemed, had deemed them smart; Harvard told them they should expect to be treated that way.

# Have you tried…?

In Silicon Valley, we would never. 

We would never LARP as entrepreneurs; we *are* entrepreneurs. We wouldn’t be fooled by an MBA; the only degree we care about is a [GSD](https://medium.com/@dexter.shawn/15-successful-entrepreneurs-give-us-their-thoughts-on-the-mba-program-fbae2c7b954a#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhen%20it%20comes%20to%20success%20in%20business%2C%20an%20MBA%20degree%20is%20optional.%20But%20a%20GSD%2C%20which%20is%20only%20earned%20by%20Getting%20Stuff%20Done%2C%20is%20required%E2%80%9D). We build real things, solve real problems, and reward the best ideas over the longest resumes. 

Or do we? For all the disdain we have for business school, my class visit felt eerily similar to one of Silicon Valley’s most iconic rites: [The investor pitch](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=silicon+valley+hbo+pitch). For early- and mid-stage companies, most pitches follow the same arc. Founders present a problem. They show a few slides or screens of a product that they think will address it. They put forward a vision for what’s next. VCs then scratch their chins, and shotgun feedback back at the founders. Have you tried branding your product in this way? Don’t you think you’d be more successful selling to another market? Have you thought of building this feature? Shouldn’t you partner with that service? Wouldn’t a different pricing model be better?

Most of these suggestions are naked copies of industry fads or the VC's latest successes. When we were raising money for Mode, an investor who led a successful social product told us that we should consider adding [chat heads](https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/16/chat-heads-coming-to-ios-facebook-app-via-update-pushing-out-anytime-now/) into a BI tool. Another person said that Mode would only work if we built an in-memory database, just as his company had. A VC who made a lot of money investing in New Relic wondered why we weren’t building a query language like [NRQL](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/). An associate that led a growth team for a consumer app tried to convince us we should spend most of our time optimizing our product’s viral activation loops.

Like the ideas that fell out of the heads of Harvard’s students, these suggestions weren’t necessarily wrong.[^3] But they weren’t insightful or clever either. They were the recommendations of someone who’d seen other companies succeed and fail, and was blindly extrapolating those outcomes[^4] onto a new company they knew next to nothing about.[^5] 

But no matter how inane and infeasible the idea—to say nothing of how insulting it is that someone who’s been familiar with a company for an hour has the gall to think they cracked a code that its leaders and employees couldn’t after years of work—founders practically have a fiduciary duty to play along. They have to nod, indulge, and say, “That’s definitely interesting; we’ll give it some thought,” even though it isn’t, and they shouldn’t. 

Just as MBA students can walk out of classrooms convinced of their own savvy, the dynamic in these pitch meetings—in which VCs’ ideas get proposed, applauded, and never tried or tested—perpetuates a core myth in Silicon Valley: That the successful entrepreneur, which many VCs are, possess a singular genius that’s always worth listening to. That people who can start and run a company, as genuinely hard and impressive as that is, are more than business executives, but modern-day Kings Midas,[^6] uniquely capable of turning [banal platitudes](https://twitter.com/naval) and [“first principles”](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/18/why-elon-musk-wants-his-employees-to-use-a-strategy-called-first-principles.html) into the solutions to all of society’s ills, [experience be damned](https://thielfellowship.org/). That their ideas aren’t pedestrian and obvious, but brave and visionary. That Silicon Valley’s ruling class are all very smart boys,[^7] and we should expect to be treated that way.

# Naked and famous

If you’ve never had the good fortune of cringing through a meeting like this, now you can, courtesy of Elon Musk:

This ninety-second clip has it all: A very smart boy, pitching a [tired and unworkable idea](https://www.cjr.org/opinion/micropayments-subscription-pay-by-article.php) to a sycophantic audience that’s affirming his ingenuity the whole way through. Nobody tells him that it’s been [tried numerous times before](https://halcrawford.substack.com/p/micropayments-the-news-idea-that). Nobody looks up why [it didn’t work](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2019/06/dutch-news-aggregate-website-blendle-ditches-pay-per-article-service/). They just clap, as Twitter [burns itself to the ground](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/04/business/dealbook/twitter-layoffs-elon-musk.html). 

All of this feels particularly salient today, as [Elon Musk and his sidekicks](https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1586798226593546240) nuke Twitter from the inside out. The rationale for this action, and for the wild product pivots, is that the company and product are broken, and only a visionary like Elon Musk can fix them. And not just the technology, as Twitter isn’t a company with technical problems but with [political ones](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation). It takes a man like Elon Musk, we’re told, to stand up to woke mobs, to censorious governments, and to Nazis;[^8] [to make Twitter a public good](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1507777261654605828); to make Twitter a better place; to make [the world a better place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-GVd_HLlps). 

It’s possible, of course, that the train wreck happening at Twitter works out. [Twitter Blue](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587498907336118274) may work; [Twitter OnlyFans](https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1587748968590622720) may work; [Twitter for enterprise](https://twitter.com/Jason/status/1587860096951799808) may work; [the Vine reboot](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586918804780630016) may work. [Twitter Battle Pass, Twitter Achievements, Twitter Happy Hour, Twitter Streaks](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587861127165136897) may work. [Twitter for Tesla](https://twitter.com/rationalwalk/status/1587427876529471489) may work.[^9] 

But if it tears itself down—if Twitter ferments into another toxic backwater, overrun with misinformation, frothing violence, and scams and scammy ads, as so many are warning it will—Silicon Valley’s reputation should go with it. 

The ugly experiment at Twitter is becoming the ultimate test of tech industry dogma, and of entrepreneurs’ supposed golden touch. Because as of last week, Twitter is being run by Silicon Valley’s unchecked id. Move fast and break things? Check—Elon Musk and his sidekicks are [making it up as they go](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587312517679878144). Reject expertise and authority? Check—they’re doing product development via [impulsive Twitter survey](https://counting.substack.com/p/were-getting-to-see-product-development), and their engineering leadership appears to have been replaced by [yes-men from Tesla](https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1586798226593546240).[^10] Follow first principles? Check—they’ve thrown out every playbook and every piece of advice. Get out of the way of the visionary entrepreneur? Check—Elon Musk asked to [review Twitter’s code himself](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1586127052767318016). It’s the tech industry’s pithy corporate canon, distilled into a caricature of itself, and applied—unlike the ideas of business school students and venture capitalists who pop off from the sidelines—to the very real world at a very perilous political moment. 

If they succeed, fair enough—credit where credit is due.[^11] But if they fail, there shouldn’t be any [participation trophies](https://twitter.com/MichaelDell/status/1587823471354068992), or [pathetic fawning over their “common sense” brilliance](https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1587255299391590401). There should be hell to pay, starting with a serious questioning of the ideas Silicon Valley promotes and the people it elevates.[^12] Our emperors have no shortage of confidence; now we’ll find out if they have any clothes. And if they don’t—and throw society to the wolves while proving it—they should expect to be treated that way.

# Data’s day of reckoning

*They’ve got data marts like gold, and ours are a little more like stone.*

---

![Peat takes millennia to generate, and bogs store 10 times more carbon than  forests — using it in gardening is madness - Country Life](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ODhJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48b9ddc4-4211-4910-8f1d-1ef0a62a0121_2560x1707.jpeg)

[Tools are out; people and processes are in.](https://twitter.com/matsonj/status/1590568105788731392)[^1] 

After two years of excited debate about data startups and technologies, and hype about the modern data stack, the zeitgeist—and [collapsing SaaS valuations](https://www.saas-capital.com/the-saas-capital-index/)—wants us [to move on](https://olivermolander.medium.com/is-it-time-to-rebrand-or-rethink-the-modern-data-stack-5d76366e3c95) to the more pragmatic stuff: How to build teams, how to find and solve meaningful problems, how to collaborate, how to “do the work.” All the technology in the world hasn’t saved us from [arguing about mismatched dashboards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_T3wK2N9eY&t=94s); better data teams and cultures, [modeled after those inside the best companies in the world](https://twitter.com/sarahcat21/status/1590054662551764992), might.

Fair; I’m all for those conversations.[^2] But underneath this pivot is an unnerving worry that I can’t quite shake. Even if we have the tools that companies like [Netflix](https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/noteable-expands-analytics-tools-for-programming-with-new-21m/), [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuery#Design), [Airbnb](https://www.geteppo.com/blog/series-a), and others have, and even if we copy their cultures and hire their employees, we’re still missing the third leg of their gold-plated analytical stool: Their data. And without that—and without similar business problems to apply it to—I’m not sure how much all of the data industry’s recent sound and fury is really worth.

# It’s not a data lake, it’s a peat bog

True or not, and with no disrespect to the pioneers in [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research) and [decision support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_support_system), [most people see Silicon Valley](https://www.bigdataframework.org/short-history-of-big-data/)[^3] as the birthplace of today’s modern data practices. Iconic tech companies’ data teams [were the field’s first superstars](https://venturebeat.com/business/linkedin-data-science-team/), coining the [terms](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century#:~:text=It%20was%20coined%20in%202008%20by%20one%20of%20us%2C%20DJ%20Patil%2C%20and%20Jeff%20Hammerbacher%2C%20then%20the%20respective%20leads%20of%20data%20and%20analytics%20efforts%20at%20LinkedIn%20and%20Facebook.) and creating the [technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presto_(SQL_query_engine)) that define the industry today. These teams were also huge profit centers for their employers, optimizing products, ad markets, and business operations to the tune of billions of dollars in revenue. It was these companies, and their staggering fortunes, that inspired the analogy that [data is the new oil](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data).

When we ask how they were so successful, we typically credit their teams and their talent. They were great, we say, because they were so good. 

The converse, however, is just as plausible. Facebook and Google, for example, can clearly make a lot of money by using their data to serve better ads. Netflix can clearly improve its business by using viewership logs to better promote the content that they offer. Uber can clearly make their service better by shortening wait times. And all of these companies operate at such an extraordinary scale that seemingly trivial improvements are amplified into meaningful financial gains. In these contexts, data has tremendous leverage—leverage that, even if used clumsily, could still produce impressive results. 

In other words, rather than being exemplars of good data practices because they were so good, it’s possible that they’re exemplars because *they didn’t have to be that good*.

In that light, when the rest of us struggle to keep up, it’s not because we don’t have their tools or cultures; it’s because we don’t have their data. The data of a mid-sized B2B SaaS product simply doesn’t have the potential energy of Google’s search histories, or of an Amazon’s browsing logs.[^4] If the latter examples are the new oil, the former is a new peat bog. No matter how good the tools are that clean and analyze it, how skilled the engineers are who are working on it, or how mature the culture is around it, it’ll never burn as [hot or as bright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density). 

This is why I think, if you wanted to put forward case for how the entire modern data stack fails, the [most tilted argument](https://medium.com/@laurengreerbalik/how-fivetran-dbt-actually-fail-3a20083b2506) making that claim—that today’s tools let people build inefficient infrastructure that encourages companies to solve problems with expensive brute-force computing—is looking in the right direction, but makes the wrong point. 

Consider cloud computing. Companies spend massive amounts of money on AWS, GCP, and Azure—multiples more than they do on data tooling. Moreover, a lot of this spend is probably unnecessary: Services are over-provisioned; they run inefficient code; problems that could be solved with better engineering are solved with more EC2 instances. And yet, save the [occasional skeptical look](https://a16z.com/2021/05/27/cost-of-cloud-paradox-market-cap-cloud-lifecycle-scale-growth-repatriation-optimization/), we’ve generally accepted that this is the cost of doing business in 2022. The value that most customers get out of their cloud provider—even with mediocre development teams and lazy deployments—is so plainly high that companies are willing to absorb those inefficiencies. Even with extraneous spend, there’s plenty of [consumer surplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_surplus).

For companies like Netflix and Airbnb—the ones whose data is high-grade oil—the margins on data investments[^5] are similarly high. Inefficiencies don’t drown out the benefit. But companies that are harvesting peat, for whom data has fewer clear applications, don’t have those margins. For them, emulating the practices of high-margin businesses—i.e., those that can afford inefficiencies in their data initiatives—is a trap. Peat suppliers can’t copy the refinement methods and cost structures of oil producers and still expect to come out ahead; small SaaS businesses can’t operate as though their data has anywhere near the same value as Uber’s or Airbnb’s. And yet, that’s what most of us do—we assume that there are diamonds buried in our rough data, if only we clean it properly, analyze it effectively, or stuff it through the right YC startup's new tool.[^6] 

But what if there aren’t? Or what if they’re buried so deep that they’re impractical to extract?[^7] What if some data, no matter how clean and complete it is, just isn’t valuable to the business that owns it?

# Gas over SaaS

To illustrate this point, suppose that you’re banished (or raptured away, you choose) to some west coast exurb. You decide to embrace the analog life, and buy a gas station just off the interstate. For a while, you run it like I’d imagine most gas stations are run.[^8] You price your gas based on how much it costs to buy, adding or subtracting a few cents to stay competitive with the Citgo a half-mile up the road. You tried staying open 24/7, but you didn’t get many customers late at night, so now you close at 11 p.m. You replace expensive gas lines and pumps only when they break. You take all major credit cards.

One morning, a traveling salesman shows up with a magical offer: For a moderate fee, they can give you, in perfectly clean and queryable form, a dataset of every interaction your customers have ever had with your gas station. It’s the holy grail of corporate data—what your customers bought, when they bought it, how much it cost, how long they were at your pump, if they were on their phone when they were.[^9] The data also captures every demographic detail about the customer, and includes exact information about who they are, what they do, and the car they drove. It even tells you what was happening inside of their heads, from what brought them to your gas station to what they thought of it when they left. 

At first glance, it’s a gold mine of incalculable worth—every question answered; every curiosity satisfied. But upon a bit more reflection, that value starts to fade. Your costs are largely fixed by external markets; no analysis will get you cheaper gas. You can adjust your prices, but those are anchored to your costs and to what your competitors are charging up the street. You already know, from checking tank levels every week, that customers prefer regular gas over the higher octane varietals.[^10] The dataset might reveal that you get a lot of Toyota Siennas at your station because you’re close to an elementary school, but you aren’t going to run Facebook ads targeting van owners or young parents. Even if you find out that customers think your pumps are slower than most, it’s not affordable to replace them unless you need to. Maybe you decide to stop taking American Express, and save dozens of dollars a month.

Put differently, as enticing as the salesman’s offer is, his data wouldn’t materially change how you manage your business. Looking at monthly spreadsheets and periodically talking to customers is guidance enough. The omniscient dataset isn’t worth the cost.

# WAGMI

Obviously, most companies aren’t gas stations. But most aren’t Square or Stitch Fix either. They probably sit somewhere in the middle, with moderately valuable datasets that can inspire moderate business improvements. That’s not bad, but it’s the promise that a lot of companies seem to think they’re buying.

If there’s a reckoning in the data industry, it’ll come from our expectations of data coming back to earth. It’ll come from companies who saw what a handful of trendy high-flyers were able to do with data, and thought that they should do the same without questioning if they actually could. It’ll come from business leaders believing that being [data-driven wins](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-data-driven-companies-win), and not recognizing the importance of the data that’s doing the driving.[^11] It’ll come from people realizing that, no matter what tools they buy or who they poach from Google, data will never be to them what it is to Google. 

To avoid this kind of meltdown (and it’s been a [big](https://twitter.com/FTX_Official/status/1591071832823959552) [week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-11/trump-blasts-murdoch-s-news-corp-desantis-as-he-teases-2024-bid) [for](https://twitter.com/BlockFi/status/1590875997351866368) [meltdowns](https://www.platformer.news/p/inside-the-twitter-meltdown)), I think we have to be more targeted in our ambitions, as both data teams and as data vendors. Focus on proven tooling and use cases—reporting, dare I say decision support—over moonshots. Focus on identifying which few datasets have real value, rather than assuming it’s all of them. And perhaps most of all, rather than trying to copy the companies whose oil fields made them rich, focus on the learning from the businesses that are build on peat bogs.

# Bonus: Survey results!

Four months ago, I asked [people how they would rank](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-data-driven-companies-win#:~:text=Who%20do%20you%20invest%20in%3F%20Join%20the%20fantasy%20league!) the value of five types of competitive edges in a startup: Experience, speed, operational excellence, data savvy, and talent. 

Surprisingly to me, experience won. Twenty-nine percent of the 171 respondents voted for that as their top choice. Data savvy was the second most-popular top choice, with 21 percent of the votes. And nobody cared about operational excellence.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0G5l!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6183e2a1-6ec8-4e37-af39-24f8bc8d39d7_994x348.png)

Experience, however, was somewhat more polarizing. The net approval rating of experience—the percentage of respondents who put experience in their top two choices minus the percentage who put it in their bottom two—was only 9 percent, compared to an approval rating of 16 percent for data. 

Furthermore, data was preferred by more than half of all respondents in every head-to-head comparison.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0b9i!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd334215b-d129-41cb-8c44-88976df1c51f_1102x330.png)

Still, the differences between all five characteristics are relatively small. So the main conclusion may be that, even among what’s likely a biased audience—the benn.substack.angellist.com syndicate is probably, for better or for worse, more embedded in the data world than most—a lot of investing comes down to personal opinions.

But these are slow deaths; we can see the life—i.e., the 18- to 34-year old demographic—gradually drain out of our feeds. Twitter is being called [from inside the house](https://youtu.be/v-8u7gSFqsU?t=352); it is being murdered; [organs are failing](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/two-twitter-executives-resign-musks-chaotic-run-continues-rcna56597); [it’s losing blood](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/technology/twitter-elon-musk-ftc.html); it could practically die overnight, at the height of its cultural power ([and popularly, evidently](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1593455727611215872)). Its obituary is getting drafted before our eyes, blow by blow, *New York Times* news alert by *New York Times* news alert. But its will is not yet written; we have no plan for what happens next, after Twitter dies, after it [becomes OnlyFans](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-adult-content-sex-twitter-content-moderation/amp), after it’s refactored down to its [ten most salient lines of code](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1593651264419684359)—only to descend further into the bleak beyond.

Frauds née [wunderkinds](https://youtu.be/8U6IlXFKKzE?t=153) like Sam Bankman-Fried are also not new—Elizabeth Holmes deserves more credit than that. But unlike Theranos, which was financed by people on the [fringes of Silicon Valley](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/opinion/dont-blame-silicon-valley-for-theranos.html), FTX raised from Silicon Valley’s most celebrated firms, its “most sophisticated investors.” They didn’t just promote their participation; they commissioned a [13,000 word epic](https://web.archive.org/web/20221027180943/https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-spotlight) to champion it. Theranos merely adopted Silicon Valley; FTX was [born in it, molded by it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F157geaXp_w) And none of its storied backers saw through it, even though there was [no board](https://twitter.com/GRDecter/status/1593272143621640195); there were [no financial statements](https://twitter.com/kadhim/status/1593225874576494592); there was [no list of who even worked there](https://twitter.com/GRDecter/status/1593272153234866177).

The answer to [Matt Levine’s question](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-14/ftx-s-balance-sheet-was-bad)—*where did the money go?*—could reasonably be that they lost it, not by gambling it away, or squandering it on lavish lifestyles (though [they did that too](https://twitter.com/kadhim/status/1593226977317900288)), but by putting it [in a bank account they lost track of](https://twitter.com/GRDecter/status/1593272148017176577). We can’t have the internet anymore, because it is down and someone [lost the keys](https://twitter.com/cullend/status/1445156376934862848).

*We’re still all trying to find the guy who said we shouldn’t be.*

It’s easy to [complain](https://benn.substack.com/p/has-sql-gone-too-far). It’s easy to [be skeptical](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-snowflake-fails). It’s easy to say it’s all [overhyped](https://benn.substack.com/p/data-contracts) and [overvalued](https://benn.substack.com/p/free-fall#footnote-5). It’s easy to look at the rough edges of an unfamiliar tool, and [wonder why such obvious problems haven’t been fixed](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-original-purple-people#%C2%A7google-is-wasting-all-the-good-cards).[^1] 

There’s a place for this sort of commentary[^2]—this kind of [community of inquiry](https://twitter.com/drvolts/status/1594475225332482048) is how we stumble forward together. But in only pointing out those flaws, looking at the uneven ground at our feet, it’s also easy to lose track of just how far we’ve traveled. Even in the relatively short amount of time I’ve been working in the data industry—I took my first tech job as an analyst at [Yammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yammer), a B2B SaaS company, in 2012—the amount of collective progress we’ve made has been dizzying. 

In the early 2010s, the data teams at [LinkedIn](https://venturebeat.com/business/linkedin-data-science-team/), [Facebook](https://marker.medium.com/the-untold-history-of-facebooks-most-controversial-growth-tool-2ea3bfeaaa66), and [Zynga](https://www.mercurynews.com/2011/11/22/2011-social-gaming-pioneer-zynga-poised-to-go-public-in-closely-watched-ipo/#:~:text=He%20argues%20that%20Zynga%20is%20%E2%80%9Creally%20an%20analytics%20company%2C%20not%20a%20gaming%20company.%E2%80%9D) were seen as revolutionaries, but inimitable ones: They were funded by massively hyped tech companies, flush with technical experts, and worked with some of the biggest and [most monetizable datasets](https://benn.substack.com/p/day-of-reckoning) in the world. They were blazing trails, but trails that weren’t easily followed. 

Yammer’s analytics team—my introduction to the data world—was a pioneer for [the everyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyman).[^3] Though Yammer was a “high-growth” startup, it was a pedestrian one, no different than dozens of other tech companies of its size. Unlike the data science team at Google, which was [organizing all the world’s information](https://about.google/), our objective as analysts was to use product usage logs and CRM data to help a sales team hawk software to IT departments. Rather than trying to solve new problems or invent new uses of data, our explicit goal was to apply techniques stolen from Facebook and social gaming to sell enterprise software.[^4] To achieve that end—which is more or less the goal of nearly every data organization now—my bosses built a data organization that looks [a lot like those of 2022, but without the glossy sheen](https://putthison.com/is-george-costanza-aime-leon-dores-muse/) from ten years of [IT consumerization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerization_of_information_technology), YC-backed data startups, and trendy thought leadership. In other words, we were a modern data team without the modern data stack. 

It’s a team, then, that offers answers to two questions: How did data teams actually work ten years ago? And how would teams have to work without the last decade of growth and innovation?

# Proto-modern

Just as our team wouldn’t look entirely out of place in a startup today, the architectural outlines of our data stack would be pretty familiar too. The modern data stack didn’t exist—this was 2012; Redshift, which [arguably catalyzed the entire movement](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/future-of-the-modern-data-stack/#:~:text=In%20my%20opinion%2C%20the%20modern%20data%20stack%20catalyzed%20around%20the%20release%20of%20Amazon%20Redshift%20in%20October%20of%202012), hadn’t been released yet; we were still all enamored with [the possibilities of Hadoop](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=hadoop)—but we ran a proto-version of it: We ingested data from a handful of sources into a centralized warehouse; we transformed it in the warehouse using a DAG of SQL scripts; we pushed that data out through ad hoc analysis, BI reports, and a handful of department-specific tools.[^5] We didn’t recognize any of these patterns by their current brands—ELT, analytics engineering, data apps—but the shapes were the same. 

The experience of using it, however, was not. 

## The storage layer

[Vertica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertica), a columnar-store analytical database, sat at the center of our data stack. Like most databases at the time, we couldn’t buy a hosted version; instead, we bought a license—for about half-million dollars a year[^6]—to run the software in some server rack we leased in a data center in San Jose.[^7] Since we were responsible for its own uptime, Vertica had to be maintained by a [DBA](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-a-dba/), whose job was to monitor the cluster's instruments, and make sure everything was healthy.[^8] 

Routinely, it was not. Bad queries had a tendency to send [nodes](https://techlibrary.hpe.com/docs/otlink-wo/Database-Nodes.html) sideways, which would not only clog up the warehouse, but would also require a coordinated set of operations to rehabilitate.  What exactly caused these problems and how exactly were they fixed? I never quite knew. But I knew I had to be delicate, or else I'd send the people staring into the matrix on vertical monitors into furious fits of SSH'ing in and out of remote boxes, while everyone else fielded angry emails from execs about their dashboards being out of date. 

After Yammer was acquired by Microsoft, we dabbled in “big data” alternatives to Vertica, eventually settling on Cosmos, Microsoft’s then-internal and [now-public NoSQL warehouse](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cosmos-db/#overview). I remember being told there was useful data in Cosmos, though I never figured out what it was, because accessing it required writing queries in some [Frankenstein language that mixed SQL and C#](https://www.goland.org/whatiscosmos/). So I stayed away, and let other people write the 800 lines of .NET-flavored MapReduce that was needed to parse SharePoint’s usage logs into an estimate of daily active users[^9]—and hoped that knowing that number wasn't important to the company. 

## The ingestion layer

Our ETL architecture was strikingly modern—but, much like our warehouse, plagued by problems that don’t concern today’s data teams. Nearly all of the data in Vertica came from three sources: The application Postgres database that powered Yammer’s product, an event stream from that same application, and Salesforce. In all three cases, we did very little transformation in flight.

To my knowledge, the application replica and its event stream were reliable and required very little babysitting—less, in fact, than Postgres-to-Snowflake-or-Redshift connectors do today. Salesforce, by contrast, was a nightmare. We had to build our own service for extracting data from its APIs into Vertica, and, despite an engineer working on the problem nearly full-time, it was a perpetual wreck. The Salesforce APIs were brittle. The Salesforce admins on the other side of the office would sometimes change Salesforce schemas, which would require updates to our connector. When something broke, extraction jobs would get backed up, and, like Vertica, require careful handholding to revive. 

Because of this ongoing fire—and the cost of containing it—we generally avoided sourcing data from other third-party sources. An effort to get data from Exact Target, a marketing automation tool for sending emails, took several months; an effort to get data from Jobvite never made it past a hack day. 

## The transformation layer

Once loaded into Vertica, raw data was [modeled by Integritie](https://benn.substack.com/p/down-with-the-dag#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20that%20tool%2C%20Josh%20also%20created%20an%20internal%20data%20transformation%20tool%20called%20Integritie), our homemade transformation tool. It was similar to dbt, minus a bunch of developmental niceties: There was no IDE for it; you couldn’t run models in staging environments; jobs were written in raw SQL, without Jinja or macros.[^10] Instead, we followed a “works on my machine” model of development. Run queries locally, copy them into the Integritie repo, deploy it, and hope production runs as expected. Sometimes it obviously did, and sometimes [it obviously didn’t](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s58/client/snv?noteGuid=fefd12d0-7824-4255-b27e-e6dc8e1ea203&noteKey=78ad63094298178f&sn=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evernote.com%2Fshard%2Fs58%2Fsh%2Ffefd12d0-7824-4255-b27e-e6dc8e1ea203%2F78ad63094298178f&title=Screenshot%2B11%252F23%252F22%252C%2B10%253A56%2BAM). But most of the time, the query executed correctly, and—without any kind of testing environment or way to see how tables actually changed—our best gauge of how well something worked was if someone complained about it later. 

Given how easy it was to overrun Vertica with long-running queries, we spent a lot of time optimizing the jobs in Integritie. Models were almost required to load incrementally; rebuilding large tables was costly, and had to be manually orchestrated. This amplified the challenges of resolving upstream issues like Vertica getting backed up or Salesforce syncs stalling. We couldn’t just unplug it and plug it back in; we had to make sure failed jobs didn’t restart all at once, and nurse the pipeline back to health.

## The consumption layer

All of this effort and expense—which probably totaled a few million dollars a year in software costs and salaries—powered a handful of applications that drove “business value.” The analytics team spent most of their time in a [browser-based SQL editor](https://benn.substack.com/p/internal-tools-make-lousy-startups#:~:text=Mode%20was%20based%20on%20something%20we%20built%20at%20Yammer%20and%20Microsoft), with some very basic charts on top. We got questions, wrote queries in the tool, and sent URLs with answers back to whoever was asking. These links were our crude audit trails, and internal communications, Excel files, and Powerpoint speaker notes were littered with them. 

The data engineering team also built a few proper data apps for more durable use-cases. There was an executive dashboard that showed our most important KPIs, with a few simple filters; there was an site for profiling customers and aggregating how healthy their accounts were; there were a set of pages that were embedded directly inside the Yammer application so that customers could see a few vanity metrics on how they were using the product. These were applications in the truest sense: They were built in Rails, hosted on their own servers, and ran on top of dedicated databases. As analysts, our only involvement in the development of these tools was to create tables in Integrie that mapped to exactly what each application needed. The app would then retrieve our tables and—assuming we’d formatted everything correctly, which I often didn’t—update the apps.

Most of these tools, however, were feeders into Excel.[^11] The email lists we sent to marketing got exported to Excel, and uploaded into Marketo. Product managers, wanting to tinker with A/B test results, exported reports to Excel. The monthly board deck was built in Powerpoint using charts that were generated by copying query results into “raw” data tabs in a giant Excel workbook. None of it was peer reviewed or versioned, and only some of it was centrally organized. Instead, much of our work—the culmination of all the technology that sat underneath it—was scattered across Dropbox folders of SQL queries and `_v3_final.xlxs` files.

*An actual screenshot of what it was all for.*

# The questions we should be asking

The tools we have today—built and supported by thousands of people across dozens of companies—represent a profound leap forward from what we had then. And their effect extends beyond easing the daily frustrations of existing data scientists; they also made the work we did in 2012 accessible to a far greater range of companies and aspiring analysts and analytics engineers. Nearly part of the industry is breathtakingly easier, faster, more powerful, and more reliable than it was a few short years ago. 

Except us.  

Because there’s one nagging inconvenience in the comparison between today’s data teams and the one I was on in 2012: Yammer’s data team was as impactful as any that I’ve ever worked with. It was a key part of the product development process; its members were honorary members of the marketing and customer success leadership groups; it was respected, in-demand, and had a voice in the strategic direction of the company. And all this was done on top of technology that was, relative to what’s available today, fragile, narrow, expensive, and powered by [now-archaic computing capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor_chronology).[^12] 

*That’s* the paradox we need to solve. Why has data technology advanced so much further than value a data team provides? Does all of this new tooling actually hurt, by causing us to lose focus on the most important problems (e.g., the data in Salesforce) in favor of the shiny new things that don’t actually matter (e.g., the data in our twenty-fifth SaaS app)? Has the industry’s talent not caught up with the capacity of its tools, and we just need to be patient? Is the problem more [fundamental](https://benn.substack.com/p/day-of-reckoning)? I’m not sure.[^13] But if our 2032 selves want to be as grateful for 2020s as we should be for the 2010s, those are the next questions we need to answer.

*A young man.*

When Lou Gehrig was 36 years and 15 days old, he delivered his [famous retirement speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Gehrig#%22The_luckiest_man_on_the_face_of_the_earth%22)—“today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth”—at Yankee Stadium. I know this because I heard a [clip from the speech](https://twitter.com/jtabrys/status/1597972559311798272) on Wednesday and, wanting to see the rest of it, found [a recording on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNLKPaThYkE). My immediate reaction from watching the video was not, as it usually is, to be shaken by the wrenching tragedy of the moment, but to think, “Oh no, he looks young.” Lou Gehrig is supposed to be centuries old, a weathered patriarch, an elder statesmen, an iron man, a granite legend. He is not supposed to look suitable to cast in *[Too Hot to Handle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Hot_to_Handle_(TV_series))*. 

I looked up how old he was during that speech: 36 years, 15 days. A couple weeks past my 36th birthday, an unsettling thought crossed my mind: How old am *I*? The answer, as fate would cruelly have it, was 36 years, 14 days. Which means the answer today, if my math is right, is now [36 years, 16 days](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?m1=11&d1=16&y1=1986&m2=12&d2=2&y2=2022). 

Wrenching stuff, indeed.

So off I went, looking up how old other people were at important moments in their lives. Dozens of celebrities later, I found myself with an leaderboard of accomplishments and disasters, of crimes and deaths, of first appearances and new relationships, with me steadily climbing it, like LeBron [marching up the all-time points list](https://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/34584960/when-lebron-james-break-nba-career-points-record). Next up, James Madison drafting much of the Constitution at 36 years and 185 days old, and Blackbeard pirating his first ship at 36 years and 244 days old. 

Until then, [do your own calculus](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html), and join me in making 101 comparisons that never needed to be made.

*[this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3)*

Imagine, [once more](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-data-driven-companies-win#:~:text=Imagine%2C%20if%20you,of%20its%20success.), that you’re a venture capitalist. You invest in early-stage startups, the sort of companies that only have a handful of employees, a few wireframes and product prototypes,  and a vision for how to [make the world a better place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-GVd_HLlps). With no revenue metrics or customer feedback to base your investment decisions on, you bet on stories:[^1] Does the company have a unique idea, can the founders build it, and is there a market for what they’re selling?  

You get an email from a startup requesting your time for a pitch meeting. You’ve heard through the grapevine that the company’s founders have been making the rounds among other VCs, and, despite [being experienced](https://benn.substack.com/i/83946516/bonus-survey-results) in their field, they’ve been struggling to close an investment. But, being the founder-friendly and open-minded VC that you are, you decide to take the call.[^2] 

The pitch lands. Though you were skeptical of the initial concept, the story the company tells about its potential is compelling. You leave the meeting convinced of the founders’ brilliance for [seeing a good idea in what seems like a bad one](http://paulgraham.com/swan.html#:~:text=The%20first%20time%20Peter%20Thiel%20spoke%20at%20YC%20he%20drew%20a%20Venn%20diagram%20that%20illustrates%20the%20situation%20perfectly.%20He%20drew%20two%20intersecting%20circles%2C%20one%20labelled%20%22seems%20like%20a%20bad%20idea%22%20and%20the%20other%20%22is%20a%20good%20idea.%22%20The%20intersection%20is%20the%20sweet%20spot%20for%20startups.). You know you want to invest. The only question left in your mind is why other VCs didn’t feel the same way.

A day later, you get your answer. The company changed their pitch. Their proposed product never changed, but their story for why it’d be successful—the hole in the market it would fill, their clever plan for attracting customers, the viral loops that would drive its growth—was different in their prior meetings. 

At first, you assume that they got their new direction from a grizzled industry veteran who suggested the strategic pivot. That’s fine, you think; they’re learning! Iterating! That’s the [third step to the epiphany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Blank#Key_customer_development_concepts)! But then, the other shoe drops. Nobody came up with the new plan—an AI did. After their initial struggles, the founders asked a [chatbot](https://chat.openai.com/) for help: “Give me a [compelling ten-point pitch](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s58/client/snv?noteGuid=6918a0d4-b893-414e-9202-fa13283e90de&noteKey=959d9203a0a55dba&sn=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evernote.com%2Fshard%2Fs58%2Fsh%2F6918a0d4-b893-414e-9202-fa13283e90de%2F959d9203a0a55dba&title=%2522Siri%252C%2Bgive%2Bme%2Ban%2Bidea%2Bfor%2Ba%2Bscam%2522) for our startup, including details about why there is a market need for our product and how the business will grow.” 

Their new narrative, in other words, was manifest out of thin air. It wasn’t based on feedback from a visionary expert. It wasn’t built on research, logic, reason, or a deep understanding of anything. It was conjured by a giant computer, a really good autocomplete algorithm, and a person looking for an argument to support a conclusion. 

Do you still invest? 

On one hand, the pitch is still the pitch. The plan is still the plan. Shouldn’t we evaluate the idea on its merits alone, regardless of its source?[^3] On the other hand, would we really *not* reconsider our choice? Does knowing that a pitch deck was based solely on the motivated reasoning of an AI really not undercut its apparent logic, illogical as that may seem? 

The answer, I think, is we have to reassess. Not because the reasoning *in* the deck changes, but because we aren’t nearly as good at reasoning *about* the deck as we might think.

# Data on trial

Some time ago, a long-simmering tension inside of Mode finally came to a head. For years, the leadership team knew that we had to choose between one of two potential directions to take the company. And for years, we'd punted on making the decision to “maintain optionality,”[^4] like a person straddling two boats that were slowly drifting apart. One spring, our [flexibility reached a breaking point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJU3PrHvxn4). We had to choose. 

Since every prior effort to settle the issue had stalled, we decided to try something new: We staged a debate. A couple people were assigned to each option. They were instructed to make the most compelling case that they could for their side. Like a legal team fighting on behalf of a paying client, they weren’t looking for the truth; they were seeking a verdict. They had an argument to make, and a case to win. They were asked to use data to support their case, but the story they wanted to draw out of that data was predetermined. 

This exercise, we thought, would surface all of the important issues we needed to consider. By pitting point against counterpoint, and compelling argument against incisive rebuttal, [we’d rattle our way](https://www.facebook.com/BrianHamiltonNC/videos/448433322673242/) to a consensus. With such a wealth of evidence and analysis, our jury of sharp and well-informed execs would surely come to the right verdict. 

In the end, we played ourselves. Because of various time constraints and other external factors, one team was able to make a lengthy and robust case in their favor, while the other had to rush theirs. There was a preponderance of evidence on one side of the scale, but its tilt was a function of the competing teams’ resources, not the evidentiary body that was out there in the world. And the jury’s decision—issued quickly in the expected direction—wasn’t the result of airtight logical reasoning about each case; it was a reaction to which argument was more available.

# Foundational legitimacy

If we’re honest with ourselves, this is how most analysis works. When we read some argument or piece of analytical work—be it a proposal for a business strategy, a pitch for an investment, or an op-ed making a political point—we typically fancy ourselves as rational thinkers and impartial jurors. But we aren’t good at being either. As Randy Au called out [in his most recent piece](https://counting.substack.com/p/how-do-we-actually-pull-stories-out), sometimes "there are different hypotheses that all fit the data to a similar extent and there’s no way to tell which is the valid one.” Even trained analysts struggle to find the capital-T truth, and instead “fall into the trap of finding some initial findings that confirms a story,” with “no guarantee that any of the stories we weave out of data have any actual truthful basis!”[^5] 

Of course, we aren’t persuaded by every number or chart—we can detect obviously [spurious correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations). But we aren’t particularly good at assessing when evidence is moderately weak or moderately strong. We’re [plagued by biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies), and when we evaluate the strength of argument, we rely on logically irrelevant context—what we want, what we think of the person making the point, the polish and energy with which they make it, how many other people agree with it—far more than we might think. 

There is, however, one useful protection against us constantly being fooled by questionable reasoning: It's a lot harder to come up with decent arguments for something that's wrong than something that's right. Yes, we can [torture data to make it say anything](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/if_you_torture_the_data_long_enough,_it_will_confess_to_anything)—but making it confess a lie takes a lot more effort than getting it to tell the truth. Reality, such that there’s such a thing in a dataset, is more available. We are protected from misleading conclusions and [wild conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln%E2%80%93Kennedy_coincidences_urban_legend) not because we’re smarter than them, but because misleading conclusions and wild conspiracy theories are hard to create.

This difficulty—that, to make any kind of argument, we have to connect a bunch of dots in a seemingly reasonable way—gives most analysis a kind of foundational legitimacy: Someone had to figure it out. Someone had to weave a story that other people’s logical calculators, underpowered and imprecise as they are, would accept. If I want to make the case for why Mode should go down one path versus the other, or [why “data scientist” is a bad job title](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/the-one-where-i-take-issue-with-the), or why the 2017 Las Vegas shooting was an inside job, I have to figure out how to do that myself. I have to do the research, and construct the narrative, all my own. And the more wrong my conclusion, the harder it is to do that.

Or, at least, the harder it used to be. 

# Conclusions on demand

Last week, OpenAI released [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), the now-famous chatbot that can generate stories, poems, recipes, code, and millions of screenshots on Twitter.[^6] Backed by nearly seven trillion words of training data, ChatGPT can reply to nearly any query—including requests to make an argument that reaches a specific conclusion—with a remarkably [cohesive and confident response](https://twitter.com/bernhardsson/status/1600882762952605697). Want to defend the data scientist title? [No problem.](https://twitter.com/josh_wills/status/1599487149640155136) Want to create a conspiracy theory to argue that the Las Vegas shooting was actually carried out by the FBI? [I can have one in seconds.](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s58/client/snv?noteGuid=17872fa4-3cc3-4b62-93cc-a9660ed8ef28&noteKey=a9a301fd1b9e3a8f&sn=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evernote.com%2Fshard%2Fs58%2Fsh%2F17872fa4-3cc3-4b62-93cc-a9660ed8ef28%2Fa9a301fd1b9e3a8f&title=%2522Siri%252C%2Bcook%2Bup%2Ba%2Bconspiracy%2Btheory%2522) Want to create another conspiracy theory that says it wasn’t the FBI, but was Coach K and the Duke basketball team? [Just as easy.](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s58/client/snv?noteGuid=c455ac2b-b632-45b5-b38d-a346f80a0950&noteKey=11ac6489926754dd&sn=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evernote.com%2Fshard%2Fs58%2Fsh%2Fc455ac2b-b632-45b5-b38d-a346f80a0950%2F11ac6489926754dd&title=%2522Siri%252C%2Bdestroy%2BCoach%2BK%2527s%2Breputation%2Beven%2Bmore%2Bthan%2Ba%2BFinal%2BFour%2Bloss%2Bto%2BUNC%2Bcould%2522)

None of these are real, in any sense. Even in examples when the underlying facts are true, there is no logical thread that ties one point to the next. They are spurious correlations, wrapped in plausible arguments, told with “[high verbal intelligence.](https://twitter.com/bernhardsson/status/1600903094543732736)” 

As [Sarah Guo suggests](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1600491163915812864), I’m not sure we’re ready for this.

In the 1970s, [researchers at Stanford](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds#:~:text=A%20few%20years,he%E2%80%99d%20embrace%20it.) found the mere presence of an argument that supported a particular conclusion made people more likely to believe that conclusion was true, *even when they were explicitly told the argument was made up*. This suggests that, even in the absolute best-case scenarios—when we know some analysis was manufactured by a chatbot, with potentially no basis in fact or reason—we’ll struggle to evaluate the legitimacy of the story. 

That’s bad enough on its own. How, then, can we possibly protect ourselves when the deception is less apparent? [If we can’t unsee patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia) that *we know are illusionary*, what hope do we have in evaluating the “seemingly-feasible” arguments that can now be generated for anything (both ones we ask of ChatGPT, and ones that [others create](https://kozyrkov.medium.com/introducing-chatgpt-aa824ad89623))? Do we have any chance of making sense of that [funhouse of mirrors](https://twitter.com/pkedrosky/status/1600889992103895041)?[^7]

If ChatGPT starts incorporating data or [citations](https://metaphor.systems/) into its answers, this gets even harder. Consider, for instance, the implications of this for even innocuous corporate examples. You go to a meeting to discuss a contentious decision. Each person brings a two-page narrative making a case for their desired outcome, complete with charts and statistics that seem to support their perspective. But nobody created their reports, or reasoned their way through what they say. Instead, they told a bot what outcome they wanted, and it dumped out a report full of facts, figures, and a plausible sounding story to explain it all. 

Imagine the chaos that this introduces, not just in making decisions, but in understanding what’s even real. A few numbers and [clever adjectives](https://benn.substack.com/p/a-better-way-to-lie-with-statistics) can completely change how we perceive the world around us. Today, it takes a rare combination of talent and expertise to persuade or, less generously, believably distort. But tomorrow, all of us may have access to an obedient research team that can justify whatever we want, with whatever bias we prefer. 

The implications of that go far beyond the usual concerns about propaganda and misinformation (though those are real and significant), and could extend into even the most mundane of conversations. We use Google Maps to go places we know how to get to; we use Yelp to find restaurants we’ve already eaten at. When an acceptable rationalization for anything is a text message away, why would we not use it just as often?

For all the hand-wringing out there about the dangers of AI becoming too smart for us, it seems like we’re missing the much bigger problem: We’re not smart enough for AI. 

# The meta postscript

First, no, this article wasn’t written by ChatGPT; that joke is [already](https://twitter.com/aliabdaal/status/1583203039967850497) [overplayed](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/06/opinion/chatgpt-ai-skilled-jobs-automation.html). But I did ask it to rebut the argument that large language models threaten our ability to understand reality and make decisions. It echoed a point that others have made: Large language models surface more ideas. They open up new creative frontiers and expand the “marketplace of ideas.” We all just need to become more critical and capable thinkers.

Please. Does anyone believe that this will *actually* happen? We are lazy; we are illogical; we are biased. We will not collectively better ourselves in response to being slowly boiled by distortions of reason; we will sit in the soup until our brains melt out of our heads. 

Take this very post as an example. I’m not an expert in AI, or in psychology, or any of the other subjects that I breezily Googled and cherry-picked links to.[^8] It’s likely that I committed various logical fallacies, misrepresented some ideas, got some wrong, and extrapolated too much from irreproducible and debunked studies. It’s also possible that the whole post is unremarkable, and common knowledge to anyone who’s spent more than a few days thinking about AI. 

But do people have the time to consider all of that? (I know [18.8 percent](https://www.evernote.com/l/ADpqhLi0q0NK9remJiiTClCvnUZ0JQ7Gqz0) of you don’t.[^9])  The mere existence of the argument here, based on as little as it is, probably leaves some people in a different place than where they started. That’s not a huge problem today, because most people who don’t know about AI aren’t writing blog posts about AI. But tomorrow, there could be millions of posts just like this, disseminated by people with good intentions, by people with petty axes to grind, by legitimate bad actors, and by Discourse-addled teenagers who want to make a joke [for](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/world/europe/boaty-mcboatface-what-you-get-when-you-let-the-internet-decide.html) [the](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/austin-solid-waste-fred-durst_n_822082?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAG8AXXcgoJEN1wpNOL1_4KMk4jHFbpieoM9hA5LQJYwVsOh7yfDiYz-9NQ_2AKIHIFDpeQMKzikOiFt2pCLjfVw6ztJV6jXXoMneAnmbMe2eiK655hv41sTfcUCm9DjyqH4bUg6A0E3Ift9NoR_QFYAvt0hTp2TaFPIo9C7-CsXT) [lolz](https://mashable.com/archive/pitbull-is-going-to-alaska). If you believe that people will be able to reason through that, I have an investment in a bridge-building startup to pitch you.

# The product is the process

*Why Slack ruins companies, and why only products can save data teams.*

![Philosophy & Society — The Medium is the Message by Marshall McLuhan | by  Valentin Ducros | Medium](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0Qf6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c5e2a87-85a1-48aa-b276-7a6559e6075d_647x389.jpeg)

It’s an almost incomprehensible paradox, if you think about it. Technology and the internet—the world wide web, the information superhighway, [not a big truck but a series of tubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8XSo0etBC4)—have changed every corner of our lives, and given billions of us access to nearly unimaginable luxuries and conveniences. To name but a single example, we can not only listen to any song ever created—say, *[Cake by the Ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAzH-YAlFYc) *by DNCE—but we can also, on a moment’s notice, have a cake [delivered to our house](https://www.doordash.com/dish/cakes-near-me/),[^1] summon a car to take us to the beach, and actually eat cake, by the ocean, all while broadcasting the entire thing, live, to the entire world.[^2] More practically, we can now automate next to anything—[math](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-next-billion-programmers), [ordering laundry detergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Dash), and, almost, [thinking](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-analysis-dies).

Yet, as Robert Solow first observed 35 years ago, [none of these advances show up in productivity statistics](http://www.standupeconomist.com/pdf/misc/solow-computer-productivity.pdf). Over the last six decades, [total factor productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity)—the economic indicator that roughly measures the effect technology has on how much stuff we can make—has grown at a [stubbornly steady rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RTFPNAUSA632NRUG) in the United States. From 1960 to 1979, it grew by 14.5 percent. From 1980 to 1999, as computers graduated from nerdy novelties to everyday staples, it grew by...14.5 percent. And after two decades of [software eating the world](https://benn.substack.com/p/when-are-templates-going-to-happen#footnote-1), from 2000 to 2019 (the last year data is available), it grew by 11.9 percent. 

[It makes no sense.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_paradox) How, with all that we can do now that we couldn’t do in 1960, are we only 45 percent more productive? Countless undergraduate students and doctoral candidates—and at least one [Nobel Prize-winning economist](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1987/solow/biographical/)—have already tried to answer that question, so a part-time data analyst with a shoddily-researched Substack probably isn’t going to crack this nut in one blog post shot from the hip. But, since nobody else has proposed it, I do have a theory to throw out from the cheap seats:[^3] The problem is Slack. 

Slack, the regrettably ubiquitous chat app that was unleashed on an unwitting world in 2013, is, on the surface, an impressive technological leap over email. It connects us to all our coworkers in an instant, through a single artery of conversation and integrated applications that helps us, as Slack eagerly puts it, “[get work done.](https://slack.com/apps)” It’s fast. It’s searchable. It’s cheerful and quirky and ergonomically agreeable. It’s like plugging into a corporate Matrix, if the Matrix were designed with the confectionary aesthetic of *The Good Place*. 

And it makes us worse at our jobs. 

For years, we’ve heard about how Slack’s many inboxes and constant pings are distractions that [make us less productive](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/slack-is-the-right-tool-for-the-wrong-way-to-work). But the problem is deeper than an overeager notification trigger; it’s inherent in Slack’s DNA as a chat-first application. Because posting directly into a channel is the primary call to action, that’s where we post. This, and some people’s understandable tendency to talk in many short messages rather than a few long ones—as decades of internet chatting has taught us to do—encourage us to check Slack often and respond to messages quickly, lest something important get washed away in a firehose of other conversations and posts from bots. 

Two feature gaps make this sense of paranoid urgency worse. First, because Slack organizes channels chronologically by the first post of each thread—as is necessary in an application designed around chat rooms rather than message board forums—threaded conversations get pushed up the feed and disappear, even if those threads are very active. To see these conversations, which are presumably important given the engagement with them, you have to catch them on your own, when the thread first starts.[^4] Second, unlike email, Slack doesn’t have any mechanisms for triaging work. In email, people can manage their own workflows by marking some emails as unread, some as read, deleting some from their inbox, and putting others in folders. With Slack, the only two options are read and unread—and unread is horrifically clumsy, since it doesn’t apply to individual messages, but entire channels.[^5] In other words, Slack is a kanban board with two stages: Gone forever, and do it now. 

All of this compels us to collaborate in a frenzy of off-the-cuff crosstalk. It’s hard to follow, and makes our writing imprecise and incomplete—[which means](https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-the-worst-person-you-know-just-made-a-gr-1825121606/) our [thinking is imprecise and incomplete](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html).[^6] Yes, it’s faster, more centralized, and more integrated than email. But if we score Slack against communication tools’ more meaningful measures—does it help us make good decisions, and keep everyone informed of and aligned around those decisions?—Slack is a spectacular step backwards. 

[Slack’s advocates](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/problem-slack-isnt-charles-white/)—and [the company itself](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/why-slack-can-actually-make-you-less-productive-and-3-things-that-might-help.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CYou%20could%20say%20the%20same%20thing%20about%20email%20or%20text%20messaging%20or%20any%20technology%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20Slack%20spokesperson%20tells%20Grow.%20%E2%80%9CIf%20it%E2%80%99s%20not%20used%20in%20a%20way%20people%20find%20productive%2C%20then%20you%20need%20to%20think%20about%20the%20way%20your%20team%20is%20operating%20and%20change.%E2%80%9D)—will say the problem isn’t the tool; it’s how it’s used.[^7] [Tweak your notifications, establish best practices](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/experts-share-how-to-make-slack-less-annoying-and-distracting/), and all is better. This defense, however, rests on what I believe is a fundamentally flawed theory of human nature. Collectively, we’re lazy and unthinking lemmings. If an environment makes a particular behavior convenient, that’s what we’ll do. We follow the paths of least resistance; we take the easiest way down; we spin the wheels that come with the most grease. And unfortunately for us, Slack greases a lot of problematic ones.

That’s why, even after millions of us have been using Slack for a decade, “how to fix Slack” is still [SEO](https://www.happeo.com/blog/help-your-team-avoid-distractions-on-slack-our-best-practices) [bait](https://www.decent.com/post/10-slack-commandments-to-minimize-distraction-and-maximize-good-communication). Using employee handbooks and behavioral guidelines to push against the grain of a product is like jumping against gravity. No matter how hard we train, or [how far we can fly for a fleeting moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKg_OA6cMYA), we can never escape it.

# Tools eat process for breakfast

This doesn’t mean we can’t improve or change behaviors for the better; it means that tools are essentially the only lasting way of doing it. Slack itself proved this, just in the wrong direction. 

I think there’s a lesson in this for the data ecosystem: Tools—and as tiresome as it may feel, conversations about tools[^8]— are the only way to meaningfully move the industry forward. No matter how much we blog about best practices, or how many talks we give about better ways to work, people will eventually find their way back into the behavioral grooves cut by the products they use. 

We see this time and time again. A [viral blog post](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/03/16/engineers-shouldnt-write-etl/) got us excited about engineers not writing ETL—but it took dbt to standardize the practice. The value of code reviews was understood for decades—but “the cumbersome, time-consuming, and synchronous nature of this approach [hindered its universal adoption](https://sback.it/publications/icse2018seip.pdf)” until products like Github [made it more accessible](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PullRequest.html). We generally agree that we should protect production systems from malformed data, and that every free-range Excel file is a time bomb waiting to go off—but we won’t create data contracts until there’s a tool that makes it easy, and [we won’t get rid of Excel](https://twitter.com/teej_m/status/1603198795575005184) until another product makes it obsolete. If our goal is to improve something, like how data teams work with their stakeholders or find meaningful problems to solve, abstract ideas and new operational processes won’t carry us nearly as far as the current of our tools.

Of course, there’s still value in individual teams and companies trying to institute better operating principles and frameworks. Internally, [bikeshedding about technology](https://twitter.com/matsonj/status/1590568105788731392) can serve as a convenient excuse for [avoiding the sticky, uncomfortable confrontations](https://benn.substack.com/p/day-of-reckoning/comment/10421435) that are often required to get anything done.[^9] But if we’re going to solve the [foundational questions](https://benn.substack.com/i/86811203/the-questions-we-should-be-asking) about [our own usefulness](https://benn.substack.com/p/day-of-reckoning) *as an industry*, agreeing on process and patterns of organizational design is neither necessary nor sufficient. The tools we have, whether they have deep philosophical roots or are accidental successes, will overwhelm whatever thought leadership we chum the ecosystem with.

For proof, consider how data teams manage inbound requests. This topic has been discussed since time immemorial—and, remarkably, we haven’t taken a single meaningful step forward. We’ve written blog posts. We’ve tweeted passages from those blog posts with enthusiastic stamps of millennial approval (“💯💯💯”). We’ve saved pictures of countless slides at countless conferences. And we’re stuck on the same treadmill we’ve been on for years. More conversations about processes won’t change that. Our only hope is that someone finally builds something that makes it better.[^10] 

# The greenfield next door

That, in my view, is where there’s still a considerable amount of whitespace in the data market: For tools that solve non-data problems for data team. As Erik Bernhardsson [said about Modal](https://erikbern.com/2022/12/07/what-ive-been-working-on-modal.html),[^11] which provides hosted compute infrastructure for data teams, “data is its own discipline,” with its own technical and productivity needs. Rather than shoehorning analytics organizations into products built for other purposes, what if data teams had tools that understood the nuances of their work?

Managing work requests, which often vary wildly and come to data teams through multiple channels and DMs, is just one example where existing ticketing systems like Asana and Jira don’t quite work. Alerting is another. We often need to fix broken pipelines and stalled ELT jobs, though it doesn’t always make sense to treat these outages in the same way that PagerDuty would treat a product outage. 

There are more creative possibilities too. Are there better ways to present results in meetings other than copying and pasting charts in slide decks? Would we benefit from dedicated tools that help us curate and cull the hundreds of stale reports, Slack updates, and Excel files that we know we leave in our wake? Could data teams have their own systems of record for answering questions that enable us to live by the same mantra—”if it didn’t happen in Salesforce, it didn’t happen”—that governs how sales teams log their activities? While these may not be billion dollar businesses, they’re the products that could finally establish new norms for how data teams work within companies they operate.

To butcher every self-styled internet intellectual’s [favorite quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message), “the product is the process.” No matter how much we bang on process, we won’t solve our own productivity paradox until we get the products right.

[^4]: I’ve heard people say that using Slack is like running your company on Twitter. I think it’s actually worse than that. Retweets and Twitter’s algorithmic timeline provide a means for showing people popular tweets that they may not have seen when they were first posted. On Slack, there are no such mechanics. If you miss a thread, Slack won’t do anything to make sure you see it.

[^5]: You can, to some extent, [save messages](https://slack.com/help/articles/360042650274-Save-messages-and-files-) as a way to triage them. But this only works if you use the feature entirely as a triage tool and not as means for, you know, saving things you might want to regularly return to.

[^9]: In fairness to data teams, this is a virus that infects the entire tech industry: “If only we created the right system of rules, all of these messy disagreements would go away.” Everything from data contracts to Twitter’s moderation policies over-index on this fallacy. We’re better off [accepting the mess](https://benn.substack.com/p/analytics-is-a-mess) and building systems that work with it rather than trying to govern it away.

[^10]: Wait, what about *talking about tools*, you ask? If the point of the community is to advance the industry for future generations, I do think talking about organizational problems through the lens of a product helps do that. When we propose new processes, it’s easy to lazily extrapolate them into good results: “When we better manage our OKRs, we’ll all be more aligned and move faster, and the business will improve!” However, if we frame this proposal around a product, like an hypothetical OKR administration tool, we have to be more explicit about exactly what behaviors that tool should change, and how it should change them. In short, products are ways to ground theory. All that said, and despite likely saying stuff like this before, I’d generally reject the idea that the community *should* talk about anything (I’ll leave that job to the [General Secretary](https://twitter.com/elonmusk)). For example, people spill a lot of ink about sports and politics, without any realistic expectation of “moving things forward.” Instead, it’s just people gossiping about their hobbies. Similarly, I view much of the navel gazing that happens in data community as entertainment for its participants. To me, that’s the sign of a healthy ecosystem and something to encourage, not a thing to be stamped out in favor of a “more helpful and practical” dialogue.

# Moneyballing the World Cup

*And how you can make the roster.*

*[Elon Musk, self doxxing](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1604531789686530048/video/1)*

As an American, I have a civil duty to vote, to serve on juries of my peers, to pay my taxes, and to say that soccer is boring. Just as I’m expected to register for the draft when I turned eighteen, I’m equally obligated, when someone says soccer is a thrilling and beautiful game, to remind them that nobody ever scores, that real sports don’t routinely end in ties, and that most matches feel like an hour and a half of high-stakes keep away, with occasional breaks for [pathetic bouts of bad acting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMl5Ni7s6uc).[^1] 

But for forty minutes during Sunday’s World Cup final—from the moment Kylian Mbappé [converted his first penalty](https://twitter.com/FOXSoccer/status/1604517928036179968), through his [sidewinding one-timer](https://twitter.com/FOXSoccer/status/1604518690162380801), Argentina’s [apparent game-winner](https://twitter.com/FOXSoccer/status/1604529420735500288), Mbappé’s [third counterpunch](https://twitter.com/FOXSoccer/status/1604531653354758146), [several](https://twitter.com/FOXSoccer/status/1604527534221189126) [gasping](https://twitter.com/FOXSoccer/status/1604521616255352833) [chances](https://twitter.com/FOXSoccer/status/1604527790069424128), and a [miraculous fire sale of a save](https://twitter.com/FOXSoccer/status/1604533083633586181) in the match’s final minutes—soccer was not boring. It was a worldwide panic attack, frenzied and desperate, kill or be killed, a boxing match between two heavyweights who’d given up their guards to [throw wide-open haymakers](https://youtu.be/1AmiFfP9u5c?t=55).

Both teams landed punches, but nobody went down. The game went to penalty kicks. Normally, for a football philistine such as myself, this is what I want. After two hours of slow and subtle “beauty”—i.e, back passes to the goalkeeper and 22 of the world’s best athletes trying to [rope-a-dope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope-a-dope) each other into a mistake—penalty kicks are a welcome bit of blunt action. But on Sunday, for the first time in my American life, I felt robbed by soccer’s cruel and contrived ending. I wanted more of what I had just seen, not a gimmick of chance. 

Prior to the teams taking their kicks, the announcers on the Fox broadcast emphatically told us, as they seemed to before every shootout, that the penalty tiebreaker wasn't an arbitrary contest of [odds and evens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_and_evens_(hand_game)). Every player has their tendencies and tells; there is athleticism and strategy on both sides of the ball; it's not a game of craps but a game of chicken, with all the world watching. 

True as this may be, it misses the point. The problem with penalty kicks isn't their randomness; it's that they have next to nothing to do with the sport that everyone just played for 120 minutes. It’s replacing extra innings with Texas hold ’em; it’s resolving twelve rounds of boxing [with Super Smash Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDJDD4yaPW8). It’s skillful—the skills are just different.

For France, Argentina, and fans of soccer as its founders meant for it to be played,[^2] this is a tragedy. But for a brave manager looking to *Moneyball* their way to a title—and for any of us, looking for a backdoor onto a World Cup roster—it might be an opportunity. 

# You have one job

In the first stage of the World Cup, 32 teams play three games each. Those games, which can end in ties and therefore have no penalty kicks, cut the field in half. The remaining sixteen teams then play a single-elimination tournament, in which there can be no ties. In these games, known as the knockout stage, teams play soccer for ninety minutes. If the game is tied after that, they play another thirty minutes of extra time. If it's *still* tied, each team takes five penalty kicks.

Teams can choose who takes their kicks, but they have to pick players who are on the field when extra time expires. For this reason, teams will sometimes sneak in a player or two right at the end of the extra thirty minutes. These late subs aren’t exactly penalty kick specialists, but more akin to [defensive replacements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_substitution)—a better-than-average kicker taking the place of a worse-than-average one.[^3] 

Which raises a question: Given the staggering importance of those final five kicks, what if they *were* specialists? What if they were players who didn’t do anything else other than practice pounding the [upper nineties](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Upper%20Ninety) from [twelve yards out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)#/media/File:Goal_area_and_penalty_area_green.png)? They don’t take [1,000 shots in a summer](https://www.insider.com/world-cup-spain-practiced-1000-penalties-failed-to-score-in-shootout-2022-12); they *[make](https://twitter.com/jammer2233/status/1395113050966044674?lang=en)*[ 1,000 shots a](https://twitter.com/jammer2233/status/1395113050966044674?lang=en)*[ day](https://twitter.com/jammer2233/status/1395113050966044674?lang=en)*. They don’t need to be good defenders, or have good touch, or even understand the rules of soccer. They just need to be snipers, from a set distance. They are players with a single job: They show up to practice, stretch the leg attached to their one lethal foot, and paint the inside of the goalposts and crossbar for eight hours. 

The answer to that question—what if teams put specialists on their roster?—is that they’d be about two percent more likely to win the World Cup.

# A ghost runner on second

[Thirty-five World Cup games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FIFA_World_Cup_penalty_shoot-outs) have been decided by penalty kicks. In those games, players have taken 320 shots and made 222 of them, or 69.4 percent.[^4] Because teams often put their best kickers first, the fourth and fifth kickers typically convert at a lower rate of [around 65 percent](https://theanalyst.com/na/2022/12/world-cup-penalty-shootouts-the-facts).

This suggests that specialists could give teams a considerable edge in a shootout. The diagram below shows the hypothetical conversion rates for different penalty lineups, based on the [historical rates from prior World Cups](https://theanalyst.com/na/2022/12/world-cup-penalty-shootouts-the-facts). As it illustrates, not only would specialists improve on the average kicker, they’d also bump teams’ worst kickers out of the penalty lineup, and into the sudden death kicks. 

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p93s!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14146bce-6d1a-44ce-89f9-51970725137f_1862x1070.png)

Because penalty shootouts are so structured, the exact values of these different lineups are easy to quantify. If both teams have a lineup without a specialist, the final outcome is a coin flip, with each team winning half the time. If a team adds one specialist, their chances of winning increases to 59 percent. Add two, and it goes up to 69 percent. 

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iuBQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8cebea7-e43d-4935-a1ab-dc2db46c7625_1046x500.png)

Granted, these win rates only apply to games that go to penalty kicks. But shootouts are becoming increasingly common in the World Cup. Since 1982, twenty percent of all knockout stage games ended in penalties. In the last three World Cups, that figure exceeded 25 percent, with this year’s tournament setting a record at 31 percent.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o4q3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa35b247-5e05-4af9-8924-39781557792e_602x624.png)

If this trend holds steady at one in four games going to penalties, adding two specialists to shootout lineup increases a team’s chance of winning a knockout stage game by five percent—the 25 percent chance of the game going to the tiebreaker times the nineteen percent increase in their probability of winning if it does.[^5] For comparison, a win rate increase of five percent is roughly the equivalent to a baseball team [hitting a leadoff double in the first inning](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU202210290.shtml#all_chart). Add two specialists, get a ghost runner on second at the start of the game.

Backing up even further, since half of the teams in the World Cup make the knockout stage, teams that add two specialists to their roster at the start of the tournament would likely be a couple percentage points more likely to win the entire tournament. To make another mismatched comparison, an American football team that [holds their opponent to a three-and-out](https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401437907) on their opening drive improves their win rate by about two percent as well. In other words, a simple roster adjustment in the World Cup is like an NFL team getting the ball at the start of both halves—an advantage that no team would turn down.

What’s more, there’s no reason *not* to do it.

# A free lunch

World Cup teams are allowed to have [26 players on their roster](https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/articles/all-you-need-to-know-about-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-squad-lists), three of which have to be goalkeepers. To win the World Cup, teams have to play seven games in just under a month. Given such a grueling schedule, teams may want to load their rosters with as many pairs of fresh legs as they can. Relieving a midfielder who’s on their [fortieth mile of the tournament](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/sports/world-cup-2022/how-far-will-players-run-during-2022-fifa-world-cup-in-qatar/3969654/) might be more important than having a one-trick marksman available for a hypothetical tiebreaker. 

If that’s true, however, it’s not how teams use their rosters. In this year's World Cup—played in Qatar, which was [hot, humid](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03771-9), and presumably more physically taxing than most World Cups—teams had, on average, 2.9 players on their roster who never played a single minute. They also had an average of 2.4 players who saw less than thirty minutes of total action in the entire tournament. Though these numbers are lower for teams that made the knockout stage, very few teams relied heavily on the players at the end of their benches. 

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FBnY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70f05846-5bb8-4762-a323-c45bdba72946_902x334.png)

Moreover, in prior World Cups, teams were only allowed to carry 23 players, not 26, so teams clearly don’t *need *fifteen backups. 

The other potential obstacle to carrying penalty kick specialists is soccer’s substitution limit. Teams are only allowed to make six substitutions during a game—up to five during regular time, plus a bonus substitution during extra time.[^6] If teams need all six prior to the match’s final few minutes, they wouldn’t be able to get their specialists in before the shootout.

This shouldn’t be a problem either. First, because teams are given the extra substitution at the beginning of the overtime period, they'll always have at least one late change in their back pocket if they need it. Second, as they did with the roster, FIFA recently increased the number of substitutions available during regular time from three to five, so teams have been accustomed to playing with only three subs for decades. And finally, just as teams rarely reach the end of their bench, they rarely use all of their substitutions during games’ most meaningful minutes. Of the ten teams that participated in the five matches that went to penalty kicks this year, four had an unused sub, and all ten made substitutions in the last fifteen minutes of extra time, with several teams making multiple changes. 

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!98dK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feca16a23-7c02-4d24-a25d-acb0a8aa2791_778x714.png)

All of this points to a fairly clear conclusion. Teams could carry two penalty kick specialists, at essentially no cost to how they manage their teams. And those specialists could win games—either by dramatically improving their team’s odds in the shootout, or by inducing their opponents to take more chances in extra time. 

So, to all the World Cup managers: Don’t be cowards. Don’t look for traditional talent, and fill out your rosters with safe picks of “world-class” players that’ll get six minutes of garbage time in your [eventual quarterfinal collapse](https://fbref.com/en/matches/bb30147d/Croatia-Brazil-December-9-2022-World-Cup). Go hunting for the sharpshooting savants who can’t run, can’t pass, can’t dribble, and can’t even hold their own on a pitch full of high schoolers. But give them a ball, a white spot 36 feet from the net, and a bullseye to hit—and a World Cup to win—and they don’t miss. 

And to the rest of us: [We’ve got four years to get good at this.](https://youtu.be/Xq3hEMUeBGQ?t=58)

# Should specialists...play?

As an extended footnote, it’s also worth asking if penalty kick specialists should actually get playing time. In what strikes me as a bizarre quirk in soccer’s rules, when teams are awarded an in-game penalty kick, the player who was fouled doesn’t have to take the kick; anyone who's on field can attempt the shot.[^7] If a specialist was playing, they could take every one of these kicks. 

The math on this strategy, however, is comically lopsided. There’s an in-game penalty kick in about [one out of every three World Cup games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FIFA_World_Cup_awarded_penalties), so individual teams are awarded a kick once every six games. If the best penalty takers convert at 75 percent, and specialists convert at 95 percent, playing a specialist is worth 0.2 goals per penalty, and 0.03 goals per game. That's not much, and if anything is overstated—a team with a terrible player on the field would likely have a harder than average time drawing penalties.

The cost, by contrast, is huge. Playing with a specialist, [who would be a small speedbump who briefly inconveniences the real athletes](https://twitter.com/barstoolsports/status/1604638768211935233), would be similar to playing with only ten men—which actually happens, when players get sent off after getting a red card. [According to one analysis](http://intelligentfc.com/how-does-a-red-card-affect-the-outcome-of-a-football-match/), a red card costs a team between 0.6 and 1.2 goals in a game, far, *far* more than the 0.03 goal benefit. So add specialists to the roster, but keep them safely on the sidelines, warming up their one useful leg, away from the sport [they’re dangerously unprepared to play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqjGBqDwhUU).

[^5]: This estimate is likely a bit low, because teams that know they have an advantage in the shootout could play for that result.

[^6]: Teams that don’t use all five subs during regular time don’t lose them; unused subs roll over to extra time.

[^7]: If I were in charge of soccer, I’d change two rules. First, this one—make the player who was fouled take the shot. (If nothing else, that would keep penalty takers from having dramatially inflated goal totals. Imagine how many points Steph Curry would score if he took every foul shot for the Warriors.) And second, instead of going to extra time and then penalty kicks, soccer games should end like NHL games: [Start taking players off the field](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nhl/news/nhl-overtime-rules-2022-format-playoffs-regular-season/ra91rapepumorsdrqpouhjsg). Or even better, just make the entire game eight-on-eight. It’d be the same sport, but more open, more frantic, and, mercifully, with more scoring.

# Scoring a decade of data predictions

Fool me once, shame on you.[^1] Fool me twice, shame on me.[^2] Fool me six years in a row, like clockwork, with the same predictions about how we’re on the cusp of turning a corner, how the long anticipation is almost over, and how the waning promise of a once glittering technology will finally be realized—and you might be the founder of a data company, cranking out a list of [hastily drafted year-end predictions](https://benn.substack.com/i/93756341/it-is-not-the-critic-who-counts) that, lo and behold, conclude that the product category you’ve been trying to manifest into existence for the last half-decade is about to go mainstream in the enterprise. 

I’ve long thought that annual predictions like these were mostly filler, calorically empty content that’s easy to churn out for the sake of publishing self-serving thought leadership, maintaining an editorial calendar, and tossing out clickbait that might catch a viral updraft. Moreover, because we usually forget them as soon as they’re posted, they have little downside—good guesses are the mark of a prophet, and misses are quickly lost to the [manic throes of the internet](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-internet-2022). 

But that’s no fun. We now have at least a decade of modern data predictions behind us; why let such a fertile field lie fallow? Let’s see how we did.

# “This is our year”

To answer the most sensational question first: Most of our predictions aren’t very good. From 2012 through 2021, I found 79 articles and blog posts containing 635 predictions about the upcoming year.[^3] Excluding the sixty items that either weren’t really predictions (e.g., [”in 2013, all data is big data”](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/13-01-02-big_data_predictions_for_2013/)) or were about topics I know nothing about (e.g., [”CIOs will be on the hot seat in 2019”](https://www.datanami.com/2018/12/18/whats-up-with-2019-big-data-predictions/#:~:text=CIOs%20will%20be%20on%20the%20hot%20seat%20in%202019)), only twenty percent of the predictions were mostly right. An additional twenty percent were mixed, but more right than wrong; 35 percent were more wrong than right, and the final 25 percent were mostly wrong. In total, I’d estimate that less than half of the nearly 600 predictions issued by various experts over the last ten years could be reasonably scored as correct.[^4] 

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!836U!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58863e7d-d5a4-4f11-b970-bb3554d0333e_1552x866.png)

Is this a bad record? On one hand, [predicting the future is hard](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo/the-illusion-of-knowledge). The world is a complex place, and forecasts can just as easily get derailed by a [madman flapping his wings](https://benn.substack.com/p/nothing-to-add) as by a misunderstanding of the technical guts of the Hadoop distributed file system or a misreading of the trends in the data engineering job market. On the other hand, most of our predictions are vague extrapolations of current trends,[^5] and don’t require a subtle eye to see. Case in point: forty percent of the mostly right predictions are some version of “the data industry will grow in the cloud.” That’s not exactly going out on a limb.

[A whole bunch of predictions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cv05PA8GIbG094F_GeOCxSSSJ747yE3t6jYaIzAQOzQ/edit#gid=0)

Still, we can use ten years of predictions to make something other than a spreadsheet that looks like [Fruit Stripe gum](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ONcWN8qJL.jpg&imgrefurl=https://www.amazon.com/Fruit-Stripe-Chewing-Assorted-Flavors/dp/B0086XQUX4&tbnid=BmEzdnqWndrTWM&vet=1&docid=pOIjrEjC2U8XwM&w=1000&h=1000&source=sh/x/im); we can also use them to create a lens for looking at the road we think is in front of us. In the aggregate, forecasts are a time capsule of conventional expectations. They offer an annual peek into the industry’s zeitgeist, and a contemporary snapshot of where we all thought we were headed. If we’re wrong about 2023—as we surely will be—we’ll likely be wrong in the same ways as we’ve been wrong before.

So how have we missed in the past? We stubbornly predict, year after year, that this is finally the moment some sweeping change bears fruit. For a number of trends—the rise of AI, the importance of predictive analytics, the emergence of data marketplaces, the inevitability of streaming architectures—we’re like a heartbroken Bills fan, half-predicting and half-hoping [this is the year for the breakthrough](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/three-bold-predictions-for-bills-in-2021-buffalo-will-win-the-super-bowl/).

# Zeno, Rudi, or Daffy?

There are few ways of looking at our consistent predictions that a better future is coming [any](https://phys.org/news/2014-09-tesla-chief-self-driving-cars-corner.html) [day](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/tech/musk-self-driving-car-prediction/index.html) [now](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-11159627/Elon-Musk-claims-Teslas-fully-autonomous-self-driving-cars-available-end-2022.html). The pessimistic take is that we can’t deliver. We either can’t build what we’re promising or people don’t want it.[^6] All we can do is approach it, like one of [Zeno’s runners nearing an unreachable finish line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Dichotomy_paradox). This can only last for so long; eventually, our strings of misses [will come home to roost](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/TSLA:NASDAQ?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi_srOkpJ_8AhXjRzABHVOTAHkQ3ecFegQIIBAg). 

The more neutral interpretation of our forecast record is that it reflects the typical arc of technological progress. To adapt [Rudi Dornbusch’s famous quote](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2021/html/ecb.sp210629~e6458f8392.en.html#:~:text=The%20economist%20Rudi%20Dornbusch%20once%20said%20that%20%E2%80%9Cin%20economics%2C%20things%20take%20longer%20to%20happen%20than%20you%20think%20they%20will%2C%20and%20then%20they%20happen%20faster%20than%20you%20thought%20they%20could.%E2%80%9D) about economics, “things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought they could.” Our forecasts aren’t wrong, per se, but over-eager. We’ll get there; it’s just hard to know when. 

If nothing else, this suggests that an easy trick for making a good forecast is to say that nothing will happen. Though I don't think looking at individual predictions is all that useful,[^7] one post stood out as being notably prescient: Pete Skomoroch’s [predictions for 2014](https://venturebeat.com/big-data/4-big-data-predictions-that-wont-happen-in-2014-and-1-that-will/). They were almost all correct, and they were explicitly predictions about what *wouldn’t* happen. Though this is a bit of a cheat—no matter how good the Bills are, the field will always have better odds—it seems to be the reality we live in.

Finally, there’s also a silver lining in our history of misses. For all the things that we thought would happen that didn’t, there are just as many things that we didn’t think would happen that *did*. Outside of a few fuzzy nods towards the [emergence of a new analytics stack](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Analytics/14-for-14-Analytics-Predictions-for-2014/ba-p/2237#:~:text=A%20New%20Analytics%20Stack%20Will%20Emerge), we didn’t anticipate the explosion of the modern data stack. We thought [data would be easier to work with](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/5-predictions-for-2016-on-data-analytics-and-machine-learning/#:~:text=Working%20with%20data%20will%20become%20easier), but had very little to say about the development of new workflows, team structures, or operational standards. In 635 predictions, the potential of DuckDB, the current darling of the data world, wasn’t anywhere to be found.

If past performance is any indicator of future results, 2023 won’t look like we expect. Long-awaited changes, like AI finally delivering on its promise, augmented analytics, streaming platforms, better observability and reliability, data contracts, and the blockchain ([yes](https://www.fico.com/blogs/analytic-predictions-2018-31-flavors-ai#:~:text=6.%20AI%20Will%20Combine%20with%20Blockchain), [this](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/12/big-data-main-developments-2017-key-trends-2018.html#:~:text=And%20sure%20not%20to%20forget%2C%20blockchain%20is%20around%20the%20corner%2C%20providing%20more%20security%20and%20a%20new%20way%20of%20storing%20your%20data%20in%20a%20distributed%20safe%20way.) [was](https://dzone.com/articles/6-big-data-predictions-for-2017#:~:text=Blockchain%20Transforms%20Select%20Financial%20Service%20Applications) [real](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-trends-in-data-and-analytics-for-2020#:~:text=Trend%209%3A%20Blockchain%20in%20data%20and%20analytics)), will be slow to materialize—and the longer they take, the less likely they become. But in their absence, new and unexpected things will take their place. Here’s to them being your favorite vendor favored category, finally going mainstream in the enterprise. 

# It is not the critic who counts

In fairness to this whole exercise, if I'm going to scoff at the skeletons I've unearthed from other people's closets, it only seems fair if I bury a few of my own. So, against my better judgment, here are my six predictions—three safe anti-predictions, three YOLO bets, and six guesses that you’re probably better off ignoring.

**We won’t care about data literacy. **We’ve been saying data literacy “[will go mainstream](https://solutionsreview.com/business-intelligence/data-science-and-analytics-predictions-from-experts-for-2021/#:~:text=Data%20literacy%20goes%20mainstream)” [for](https://www.healthdatamanagement.com/articles/gartners-top-data-and-analytics-predictions-for-2019#:~:text=By%202023%2C%20data%20literacy%20will%20become%20an%20explicit%20and%20necessary%20driver%20of%20business%20value%2C%20demonstrated%20by%20its%20formal%20inclusion%20in%20over%2080%20percent%20of%20data%20and%20analytics%20strategies%20and%20change%20management%20programs.) [years](https://www.information-age.com/data-and-analytics-predictions-priorities-2020-15316/#:~:text=Prediction%205%3A%20Organisations%20will%20offer%20data%20literacy%20programs) [now](https://www.information-age.com/top-5-data-science-strategy-predictions-2020-15071/#:~:text=1.%20%E2%80%9CData%20literacy%E2%80%9D%20will%20take%20on%20the%20buzz%20of%20agile%20methodologies). Nothing meaningful happened then, and it won’t happen now. It will skip directly from a buzzword to a throwaway bullet in the *Skills* section of a resume, alongside “creative problem solver,” “excellent written and verbal communication skills,” and “proficient in Microsoft Word.” We won’t collectively be any better at it; we’ll all just know that we’re supposed to say we’re good at it. 

**We won’t develop a conscience—or pass meaningful legal frameworks—about AI. **The data industry has given lip service to ethical AI for some time now, but when push comes to shove, our better angels [usually lose to our bottom line](https://www.vox.com/recode/22465301/google-ethical-ai-timnit-gebru-research-alex-hanna-jeff-dean-marian-croak). In this macro, as they say, that won’t change. And until AI becomes a useful political cudgel, policy makers, [who are still trying to figure](https://youtu.be/t-lMIGV-dUI?t=170) out if Apple products are made by Apple or Google, won’t pass meaningful regulation. 

**We still won’t find out what a data app is. **Data apps—a blinged-out dashboard? A marketing buzzword? [Yelp?](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-future-of-operational-analytics)—have been the low-simmering rage for years now. But we still haven’t agreed on what they are or if we have them yet. This won’t change in 2023. We’ll continue to define them through the [Mirror of Erised](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Mirror_of_Erised)—as an imaginary reflection of what we wish they were.

**A data skeptic movement emerges. **After twenty years of unquestionably accepting that “data driven companies win,” an opposing school of thought will begin advocating for company leaders to rely more on their instincts. Executives will point out that Steve Jobs never cared about focus groups; they will make poorly-aging arguments about [how quickly Elon Musk makes decisions](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-best-decision-is-one#:~:text=Loath%20as%20I%20am%20to%20admit%20it%2C%20people%20like%20Elon%20Musk%20are%20effective%20executives%20for%20exactly%20this%20reason). Substack writers will shill for clicks by posting inflammatory headlines asking [if data-driven companies win](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-data-driven-companies-win). An HBR study, based on an informal survey of 32 CEOs, will get published that shows that they do not. Someone will make the comparison between data and “the science.” It will get ugly. 

**Salesforce acquires Fivetran.** Salesforce clearly wants to be the hub for enterprise applications. Fivetran becomes its tentacles, pulling data from every other vendor into Salesforce's empire. Fivetran adds Salesforce itself as a destination. Salesforce, says Salesforce, should be the brain of your business, not a database.

**The breakout product of the year is Modal. **Data people tend to be capable at writing code and terrible at deploying it. By helping address this latter problem, [Modal](https://modal.com/)—[”lambdas, but better”](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-next-billion-programmers#footnote-7-48607793)—will become the pretengineer’s (read: data scientist’s) way of using tools like stable diffusion, ChatGPT, and DuckDB. Their popularity will become Modal’s popularity.[^8]

[^2]: No, really, shame on me for [pulling this stunt twice](https://benn.substack.com/p/big-whiff#:~:text=Fool%20me%20once%2C%20shame%20on%20you.%20Fool%20me%20twice%2C%20shame%20on%20me.).

[^3]: To find these posts, I googled “data predictions 2012” (or 2013, 2014, and so on), and clicked through on the top results until I’d found between 50 and 75 individual predictions. This obviously isn’t a particularly rigorous way to gather predictions, but the sample size is large enough (and Google’s rankings probably good enough) that the forecasts are relatively representative of conventional wisdom.

[^4]: Obviously, judging whether or not a prediction is right is a subjective exercise. Given the number, I did it fairly quickly. Nor did I carefully consider all the paragraphs-long caveats to each; instead, I tried to judge the overall thrust and spirit of each one. For example, [one post predicted](https://www.concurrentinc.com/2015/01/1145/) that we’ll have better mobile BI: “Rather than elaborate visualizations, you will see hard numbers, simple graphs and conclusions,” and on “wearable devices you might look at an employee and quickly see the key performance indicator.” Though mobile BI has surely improved, I see this prediction as a miss because BI hasn’t shifted in the way that was described. All that said, if you disagree with my assessments, fair enough. [Hit me up.](https://benn.substack.com/about)

[^5]: Gartner, of all places, is an exception. A lot of predictions are barely comprehensible gestures in the direction of indeterminate destinations, like [SAS’s prediction](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2015/12/22/the-future-of-analytics/) that, in 2016, “big data has moved beyond the hype to provide real value.” [Gartner’s predictions](https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew_white/2021/01/12/our-top-data-and-analytics-predicts-for-2021/) are quantified, time-bound, and use (for the most part) nouns that have definitions. [Credit where credit is due.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoa2lzb3Jx8)

[^6]: In this way, we aren’t like Bills fans, hoping for a championship. We’re like Bills *players*, promising a Super Bowl, and then failing to get it done on the field.

[^7]: They’re like polls: Aggregate them, and don’t cherry pick your favorites.

[^8]: I’m [a personal investor in Modal](https://benn.substack.com/p/disclose-your-angel-investments), so consider this prediction to be calorically empty content that’s easy to churn out for the sake of publishing thought leadership that ends with a self-serving conclusion.
