# Is Excel immortal?

*It might not just be immortal; it might be the most immortal thing of all. *

![Secretariat | Horse Racing, Triple Crown, Belmont Stakes, & Facts |  Britannica](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w3me!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbedcc2a-49cf-4ea4-b5b2-2845125e4281_1600x1074.jpeg)
*[a tremendous machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG_27cCW5bw&t=101)*

Suppose that you used to run a big cryptocurrency company, and you committed some crimes. Your crimes made you rich and famous at first, and then they got you arrested. All of your friends, who committed a bunch of crimes too, [turned on you](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-12-22/ftx-friends-flip-on-sbf) to save themselves. They said that you [told them to](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67068611) commit the crimes, and that you committed all of the really bad crimes on your own. You got tried for your crimes, they testified against you, and you got sent to jail for a [very long time](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/samuel-bankman-fried-sentenced-25-years-prison). 

The people running the jail decide that, because you committed computer crimes, you can’t be trusted to use a computer. So, while you’re in jail, you aren’t allowed to use the internet, to make phone calls, or watch the news. Your only contact with the outside world is through the [occasional music mogul who drops by](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/music/sean-combs-sam-bankman-fried-jail.html).[^1] 

One night, early in your sentence, an [old man shows up in your cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AEkLXkDgWI). Bold entrepreneurs like you don’t belong in jail, he says; you belong in Silicon Valley, [building the next internet](https://a16zcrypto.com/). The world needs you in Founder Mode, and there is no Founder Mode in jail. He can [buy you a pardon](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/16/marc-andreeessen-ben-horowitz-trump), on two conditions. First, you have to give him good terms on your seed round. And second, you have to prove that you’re a true visionary. Show me that you can see into the future, the man says, by answering this one question correctly: Of these twelve things, which ones will no longer exist in 2075?

What do you choose?[^2]

Obviously, I have no idea what the right answers will be.[^3] But—weirdly? Disturbingly? Predictably? Comfortingly?—I can imagine vaguely plausible series of events that wipe all twelve options out of existence, except one: Excel. 

OpenAI is on pace to [burn $250 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html) between now and 2075, and [may well implode](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/openai-exec-mira-murati-shes-leaving-artificial-intelligence-114133244) this week. Social media could get [regulated into oblivion](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/technology/tiktok-us-ban-court.html), and Gen Z may [be happy to send it there](https://theharrispoll.com/briefs/gen-z-social-media-smart-phones/#:~:text=nearly%20half%20report%20that%20they%20wish%20that%20each%20of%20TikTok%20(47%25)%2C%20Snapchat%20(43%25)%2C%20and%20X%20(formerly%20Twitter%2C%2050%25)%20were%20never%20invented%2C). Google Search could [get replaced](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/technology/perplexity-search-ai-google.html) by AI. iPhones could [get replaced](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/21/24250867/jony-ive-confirms-collaboration-openai-hardware) by AI. JPMorgan Chase is a bank, and banks [vaporize themselves](https://www.fdic.gov/bank-failures/failed-bank-list) all the time. Notion could get bought by Salesforce and be [slowly dismembered](https://benn.substack.com/p/welcome-to-bennventures#:~:text=It%20eventually%20got%20bought%2C%20rebranded%20into%20oblivion%2C%20and%20tucked%20into%20some%20back%20corner%20of%20the%20Office%20suite%2C%20behind%20Microsoft%E2%80%99s%20own%20Slack%20clone.%C2%A0). Someone’s definitely going to die playing football. The [entire](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4906822-elon-musk-donald-trump-democracy/) country [thinks](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-is-a-threat-to-democracy-saying-so-is-not-incitement.html) that American democracy has a 50 percent chance of ending in a month. Tesla could bankrupt itself by trying to build a Gigafactory on Mars. The United States dollar could get surpassed by the renminbi, or destroyed by hyperinflation, or replaced by some seasteading crypto utopia, or [all three at once](https://x.com/balajis/status/1745562622186201155). Israel [could bomb](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-ground-invasion.html) Lebanon, Iran [could bomb](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/opinion/iran-attack-israel.html) Israel, Russia [could bomb](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/nuclear-weapons-who-has-what-glance) everybody, ‘til all that remains [is the arms of the angels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJpfK7l404I).

But Excel? What’s the story that would explain how Excel goes away? Microsoft gets taken over by Sam Altman, everyone quits, and the whole company is run by one guy worth $8 trillion dollars living out of [a refurbished Three Mile Island](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/20/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-constellation/)? The entire concept of money goes away, and nobody needs to [keep track of budgets anymore](https://benn.substack.com/p/welcome-to-bennventures#:~:text=but%20my%20books%20are%20an%20%E2%80%9CInvestments%E2%80%9D%20tab%20in%20a%20Google%20sheet%20that%E2%80%99s%20called%20%E2%80%9CFinances.%E2%80%9D)? Somehow, those both seem more likely than a YC company that’s “building a better Excel” actually building a better Excel.

Still, surely there is a timeline out there where Excel isn’t used anymore, and not because nuclear war annihilated everything, or because AI models got installed into our brains and we all now live in the Matrix.[^4] Surely, there is a way in which computers exist and society exists and accounting exists, but Excel does not. 

# Anti-patterns

In my head, there are two ongoing soundtracks to my life: [Gen](https://open.spotify.com/track/2OzhQlSqBEmt7hmkYxfT6m?si=0bb660195ca0417a) [Z](https://open.spotify.com/track/3WMj8moIAXJhHsyLaqIIHI?si=651a12a05d5e4d71) [pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsgNG-L6aw4) [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K00Ue-VnUw), and [famous calls during sports broadcasts](https://www.amazon.com/Crowd-Goes-Wild-Celebrated-Broadcast/dp/1570714606). Someone who’s good at stuff does something good? “[The legend…grows!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhCd0KpcJV4&t=40s)” Something bad happens? “[Uh oh..uh oh..oh no! Oh wow!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L4xWutzPKw)” Something surprising? “[I can’t spaek! I can’t spaek!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcL6bRdbO-4)”[^5] A good playlist? “[It’s banger after banger for DJ Burns!](https://x.com/awfulannouncing/status/1774577912383254683)” A car flys by you on the highway? “[That ball’s got some heat on it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxZOz5C1BbE&t=422s)” You want something? “[You gotta give us a shot!...Why don’t we get a shot?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn28Dz4RUxc&t=75s)” 

And, in the weirdest mashup of niche interests and entanglements,[^6] whenever I talk to people about their BI tool:

When “me” was Mode and “they” were a customer, I’d then go off and do the same thing that every other BI vendor does when they this story: I’d try to figure out what we needed to build to keep people in Mode and out of Excel. Because, as we all know, Excel is an anti-pattern; a workaround; a broken workflow. It’s a siloed static file; it’s a knot of opaque formulas and intermingled references; it’s a [catastrophic error](https://sheetcast.com/articles/ten-memorable-excel-disasters) waiting to happen. It’s a cliché joke about final_v2_final_sept30-DO-NOT-EDIT.xls. It’s a problem, and every other data tool is part of the solution: Modern, cloud-based, live, collaborative, versioned, code-based, scalable, and many other compelling attributes that Excel is not.

Yet, Excel is still there; still undefeated; still immortal ([!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofSQ8hx1u8I&t=497s)). Which shouldn’t make sense. If using live data is better than badly versioned files, why do we keep downloading CSVs? If freehand formulas are less reliable than well-governed BI tools, why are we constantly futzing with stuff in spreadsheets? If these are actually problems to avoid, why do we refuse to give them up?

The answer—obviously, probably—is that these aren’t bugs of Excel, but features. And if Excel is going to get dethroned between now and 2075, it seems we’ll need someone to build a better version of a tool that supports all of these supposed anti-patterns, and not one that tries to stamp them out. 

# Save as…

Here’s a thing that happens in a lot of companies. Every week, the sales team sits down to review all of the deals that people are currently working on. There’s a big list of open sales opportunities, and the sales manager asks each rep about the status of each one. People talk through what’s going on, and then write down at least three estimates for each prospect: The likelihood that they’ll close, the amount they’ll close for, and the date they’ll close. Then, all of these numbers get tallied up, and turned into a forecast. 

It’s hard to overstate how important this process is, especially for big companies that need to tell Wall Street how much money they expect to make each quarter. In 2022, Snap missed a forecast; the next day, the company was worth [25 percent less](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/21/snap-earnings-q2-2022.html). Last month, [Bumble said they got their forecasts wrong](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/bumble-shares-drop-to-all-time-low-after-cut-in-fy-outlook-71286d85), and their stock immediately fell by almost 30 percent. There’s a reason sales reps are sometimes asked for a “[blood number](https://developinginnovation.blogspot.com/2007/02/whats-your-blood-commit.html):” Miss it, and you’re dead.

Given how important all of this is, it seems like the sort of thing that should be tightly managed in a SaaS tool, and tightly reported on in some rigorously governed BI tool. The last thing a teetering VP of Sales wants is to bet their job on a bunch of scattered copied and pasted spreadsheets, right?

Well. Despite most companies keeping their lists of prospects in tools like Salesforce, and despite those tools having plenty of flashy (AI-powered!) [forecast features](https://www.salesforce.com/sales/analytics/), a lot of teams still use Excel.[^7] 

Sales reps, it turns out, aren’t reliable forecasters of their own deals. Some are chronically optimistic.[^8] Some sandbag. Some miss telltale signs that a deal is about to fall apart. So, sales managers will often make their own adjustments, based on what they know about the rep and the deal. They’ll manually tinker with things: This deal will probably come in at half of what is forecasted; this deal probably will slip to next quarter; this deal is likely to close, even though the rep is nervous about it. And they don’t want to publish all this offroading in some canonical dashboard that’s broadcast to the entire office—it is the hidden thumb on the scale, for executives’ eyes only. 

Moreover, sales leaders want* *versions of their forecast. They don’t want to see the numbers in Salesforce, as they are today; they want a saved, immutable sept_27_forecast_pessimistic.xls, to compare to this weeks’s [oct_4_forecast_without_jetblue.xls](https://benn.substack.com/p/so-you-want-to-sell-to-the-enterprise?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=A%20year%20passes,Microsoft%2C%20for%20now.).

Live, mysteriously-changing data is bad. Collaboration is bad. Restrictions on how to manipulate data are bad. Any sort of abstraction that forces sales leaders to work through some drag-and-drop visualization builder that muddies how, exactly, the fields for “deal amount,” “opportunity ARR,” and “win-probability-adjusted revenue forecast” are summed up is bad. Excel—orphaned from all other realities, saved to desktop, and barbarically updated via emails and saved as…—is good.  

But could something be *better*?

# Excel 2075

Of course, if I knew how to build a better Excel, I wouldn’t be writing a blog; I’d be worth $5.2 billion dollars and [be living in outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Simonyi). But because I write a blog, I have *opinions* about what a better Excel would need:

—

It would need to be able to open local files. If someone sends you a CSV, you could double-click on it and open it in Excel 2075. Nothing will ever replace Excel if you have to log in to use it, or you have to upload—or worse, connect to—data to it. Excel is a lot of people’s default data tool because it’s literally their default data tool: Their computer defaults to it when they try to open a file of data. This implies, I suspect, that any true Excel replacement will have to be a desktop app.[^9] 

—

One way to think about Excel is as a database and a BI tool, all packaged into a single file. When you share an Excel file, you’re sharing raw data *and* your manipulation and presentation of that data. Most BI tools are just the latter: They’re a prism, but the light that’s shining through them comes from somewhere else.

This is an underrated benefit of Excel. It’s a fixed snapshot, a sandbox for coloring outside the lines, the original [modern data stack in a box](https://mdsinabox.com/). So long as people want to play around with their data—and no matter how much we tut-tut about it, there will always be a sales forecast to [sharpie over](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/sharpiegate-and-donald-trumps-perpetual-cone-of-uncertainty)—any Excel replacement will have to be an all-in-one tool like this.

—

Why hasn’t Tableau replaced Excel? Mostly, because it doesn’t ship with [70 percent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems) of the world’s computers. But I’d guess it has a second problem: You can’t quite manipulate data directly in Tableau. You can’t look at a bunch of raw numbers, highlight the ones you want to make a chart of, and see a graph of exactly that. There’s a [layer of abstraction](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/datasource_datamodel.htm) between your charts and your data, and that abstraction [can be unnerving](https://benn.substack.com/p/ghosts-in-the-data-stack?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=But%20there%E2%80%99s%20another,needs%20above%20it.). Does my configuration for this chart do what I want it to? Does it aggregate everything up in the way that I want it to? Is there some missing row somewhere, or malformed date, or null value that I can’t see? Unless you know how Tableau works, you can’t truly know if the chart you see is telling you what you think it’s telling you.

Excel doesn’t put anything between you and the raw data. You can look at a table of numbers, look at the chart you made, and it immediately makes sense how you got from one to the other. No doubt, Excel has a learning curve, but because of closeness between data and result, it’s a much more intuitive learning curve than other tools. And a better Excel would probably have to be just as direct.

—

Still, for all their benefits, spreadsheets aren’t the only way to manipulate data. Sometimes, Tableau’s fancy charts are useful. Sometimes, a SQL join would be better than a hairy VLOOKUP. 

So far, most attempts to make a polyglot data tool [stick notebooks in BI tools](https://www.sigmacomputing.com/product/python-sql) or [stick spreadsheets in notebooks](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/explore-data/cells/calculations). But if you want to beat Excel, putting a notebook in a spreadsheet might be a better way to go. 

—

Finally, an obvious thing that a better Excel would be better at than Excel is scale. Excel still has relatively breachable computational limits. It can only handle so much data, and workbooks can only be so complex. If Excel could offload some of its work to the cloud—not by being a SaaS product, but by transparently pushing data out of the desktop app to some remote execution engine—its caps would be much higher. 

Moreover, a better Excel could also sync itself to the cloud. Very roughly, it could work like a branch of code: You work with your data locally, in your own sandbox. But then you could push your sandbox back to a central repository, or, if the central repository has changed, update your sandbox to include those changes. 

All together, none of this would feel *that* different than Excel does today. You download an application. Double click on a CSV, and Excel 2075 opens it up. You can manipulate everything directly in a spreadsheet. You can add more CSVs, by typing them in, or by dropping them in your workspace. Join them together; play with them with R; make some charts. Save the whole thing, and email it, as one file. If the data gets too big, or the computation gets too complex, push the file to the cloud, and use the desktop app to do your work on some giant computer in AWS. Let the app be smart about what to run locally, and what to run remotely. 

The thing is, this *kind of *exists. If you squint at it enough, MotherDuck, the hosted version of DuckDB,[^10] has a similar technical architecture.[^11] Through DuckDB, MotherDuck supports a [hybrid execution engine](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/running-hybrid-queries/) that lets you query data locally and remotely. It’s a sandbox and a synced service, depending on which you need. 

All they have to do now is build a MotherDuck desktop app, make it look like Excel, add charts, and reposition the entire marketing pitch to appeal to 24-year old investment bankers. 

Would it work? I mean, no, almost certainly not. But it might. And sometimes, the longest shot ([!!!](https://youtu.be/wIYD42DV3Ro?si=jjuJxrdx4zEpbfDw&t=106)) wins the biggest race of them all.

[^1]: It's very [hard to find anything good to say](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/31/nyregion/rikers-island-correction-officers.html) about the New York Department of Correction, but whoever did this—I mean, wow. Someone arrest Michael Lewis and put him in that cell too.

[^2]: Surely there’s a whole category of scam like this, right? Like:Offer people a chance to bet on something that won’t get resolved for many years. Entice them to make the bet by giving them what seems like good odds. Take their money and carefully note their bets in ways that seem very official.Spend their money on watches and cars and [Turkish Airline business class upgrades](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/nyregion/turkish-airliness-business-class-eric-adams.html).Everyone forgets? Everyone dies?Parents seem to scam toddlers like this all the time: “We’ll get you that toy when you turn eight,” which is some distant age unimaginably far into the future. There’s no way there aren’t dozens of crypto companies doing the same thing to adults, by putting bets about 2050 “on chain,” and only requiring a small downpayment to lock in your odds. Perhaps this is why you are in jail.Of course, it is also possible that you’re in jail [because of Excel](https://newsletterhunt.com/emails/22983).

[^3]: Though I guess that VC Jafar does? VC Jafar will judge your answer based on how much your opinions line up with his. A true VC, VC Jafar.

[^4]: But even then, there will be Excel. [Look at this office](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lweuy1X9Tcg). You can’t tell me these people don’t live in Excel. Neo—the Chosen One!—uses a *numpad*!

[^5]: Michael Van Gerwen, the bald dart player in this video, has a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_van_Gerwen) that is 19,000 words long and includes 275 citations. Babe Ruth’s [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth) is 20,000 words long, and has 259 citations.

[^6]: I must stress, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that BI is not an “interest.”

[^7]: I mean, citation needed. But this is a blog post, not a Wikipedia page about a dart player.

[^8]: This is also what makes them good sales reps.

[^9]: This is the biggest problem with Google Sheets. It’s basically Excel, in a browser. There are nice things about that, but it makes it clumsy to open a file with it.

[^10]: [And the second modern data stack in a box.](https://duckdb.org/2022/10/12/modern-data-stack-in-a-box.html)

[^11]: I’m a [personal investor in MotherDuck](https://benn.ventures/), and they definitely do not endorse this pitch.

# Something lost, something found

*A solid footing, a dizzying town.*

![MGM faces flak for cutting Bellagio trees ahead of F1](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uXoR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97bd882a-8bfa-463a-92e7-b7e26e60c245_1000x600.png)

It’s the little things, in Las Vegas.

Yes, there are blaring thousand-foot-tall signs advertising Cirque du Soleil shows and Usher performances; yes, there is a [paper mache Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Las_Vegas) across the street from a [paper mache Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesars_Palace) across the street from a [paper mache Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Venetian_Las_Vegas); yes, there [water cannons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountains_of_Bellagio) that are choreographed the tune of the national anthem, and flamethrowers that smell [like pina coladas](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-12-12-tm-1258-story.html). Yes, there is [The Sphere™](https://www.thesphere.com/).

But underneath all of that, up and down the strip, hidden in the bushes and pinned at the top of the palm trees, there are also hundreds of outdoor speakers, softly playing Top 40 club hits. Just in case the rest of Las Vegas isn’t enough, it’s an almost subliminal reminder that when you’re here, you’re here to party. There’s a mood in the air in Las Vegas, and that mood is The Chainsmokers. 

Corporate conferences—which are somehow both quintessentially Las Vegas, and the furthest thing in the world from Las Vegas—also have moods. There is almost always some contagious aura that quietly defines the event. The market is booming; people are rowdy and drunk. The market is on fire; people are nervous.[^1] It’s the first major event of the season, and everyone’s ready to [get out of the house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P9XUrniiK4&t=64s); it’s the last event before Thanksgiving, and everyone is ready to go home.

For its first two years, Coalesce, dbt Labs’ annual conference, was [a raucous online show-and-tell](https://benn.substack.com/p/delirium). Bring your best work, your coolest project, your offbeat interest, and teach us something [we never knew we never knew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ThO76peOw0&t=61). 

The third Coalesce was the first in-person Coalesce, hosted in New Orleans. It felt like a [homecoming](https://benn.substack.com/p/all-in-one-place), a spring party after a long winter, a real date, after a long period of only talking over text. For the last several years, the “data community”—broadly, millennial analysts and data engineers who worked in tech-adjacent industries—had existed almost exclusively online: We talked in internet chat rooms, sold each other our websites, and “met” over the occasional Zoom webinar. Though the economic ground was [crumbling under our feet](https://benn.substack.com/p/free-fall), the conferences in 2022 had a dual character: They were celebratory reunions, hosted at [the end of the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Uom8imeNQ). We all tried to ignore that second part. 

Last year, at the fourth Coalesce, the prevailing mood was anxiety. Part of that was the economic context: By late 2023, it had become clear that everyone in the conference hall could not, in fact, [build a $100 million dollar business](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-snowflake-fails?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=%E2%80%9CGo%20build%20a%20%24100%20million%20business.%20It%E2%80%99s%20all%20possible%20for%20everyone%20in%20this%20room.%E2%80%9D). In 2022, we introduced ourselves to one another; in 2023, we were asking for introductions to each other’s corp dev departments. 

But the bigger source of anxiety seemed to be dbt Labs itself. For years, the company had served as the de facto host of our community parties. They gave us an open-source project that we all used, and an event space—their Slack, and once a year, Coalesce—where we could all hang out. But in 2023, the bills were coming due. And at that Coalesce, you could sense that the offering plates were coming out. The stages were populated with more sponsored talks, more dbt customer stories, more pitches for dbt Labs’ paid offerings and fewer additions to its open-source projects.

None of this was a surprise. If the product is free, you are the product, the saying goes, and dbt had long been free. We all knew we’d eventually need to be sold. 

Still, there were whispers about What It All Means. Was dbt’s open source license [going to change](https://thenewstack.io/hashicorp-abandons-open-source-for-business-source-license/)? Was the community—that nebulous thing—going to lose its soul? Was the music stopping? There was an impending sense of loss. Was this cherished place and this party that had been always been [more about personal connection than profession transaction](https://benn.substack.com/p/all-in-one-place?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=As%20one%20new,swirl%20of%20Twitter.) drifting away?

In some sense, yes. dbt Labs hosted the fifth vintage of Coalesce this week in Las Vegas. It felt, for the most part, like a normal corporate conference. It was reasoned; measured; everything was held at a comfortable distance. There are fewer quirky community exhibitions and inside jokes,[^2] and more sponsored sessions, product demos, and customer testimonials. In New Orleans, there were rumors of after-parties going five figures over budget; in Las Vegas, a happy hour responsibly stopped letting people in because the host had hit their tab limit.[^3] In prior years, when I asked people how they felt about the conference, they told me stories about who they met and which talks they liked. This year, I was told about how many leads their booth brought in, and how they were pleasantly surprised by the ROI. 

The mood in the room—the music in the air—however, was *relief*. Sure, Coalesce is less of the cheery circus it once was, but that was never sustainable anyway. Sure, the dbt product itself is slowly [tilting the floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPklvytosy4)[^4] towards a line of cash registers, but dbt Labs was never going to survive by selling a [thin web app](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-dbt-fails?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20dbt%20is%20a%20relatively%20thin%20piece%20of%20technology%20(and%20an%20open%2Dsource%20one%20at%20that).) on top of an approachable Python package. But this version of dbt, one person told me, feels like it can last. The session that they said was most memorable was a panel of dbt execs, not for what they said, but for who they were: [People with long resumes](https://www.getdbt.com/about-us) of successfully selling stuff. 

This year, that seems like what most people wanted: Not necessarily a free dbt, but an enduring, predictable one. They wanted a dbt Labs that, instead of trying to thread a commercial thread through an open-source needle, can focus on building better products, and worry less about the awkward acrobatic act of figuring out how to sell them for money while giving them away for free. Though dbt Labs can’t cut directly through that knot—the puzzle is a puzzle because you can’t just slap a price tag on something that is open-source—they can be direct about their goals: To build good, necessary software, to charge money for that software, and, on the side, if the balance sheet lets them [get away with it](https://benn.substack.com/p/getting-away-with-it), to throw a party. This Coalesce made comfortably clear what future Coalesces will be: Mostly a means for the first two ends; a financially-motivated event, hosted by a financially-motivated entity, supported by financially-motivated sponsors; a corporate conference, not so different than the rest of them. 

But still a little different. By embracing that more stable equilibrium, the more unique parts of Coalesce start to feel less like flickering lights slowly being stamped out by some late-stage capitalist inevitability—that all fun things must be monetized—and more like the enduring bits of character that have made Coalesce the annual draw that it’s always been. We can see the dashes of color that dbt Labs’ team add to an often otherwise lifeless event calendar for their presence and not their absence. And we can stop having weighty, anxious conversations about what Coalesce is, who it’s for, and what happens next—it’s a conference, it’s for making money, and the same thing happens again next year, [in the same place](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/), in much the same way. But that’s ok, because even if the talks are sponsored, if the fun is HR-approved, and if the happy hours happen on a budget,[^5] the magic was always in the little moments—the conversation with someone who hired a former coworker, and tells you how great they’ve been; the faces to names; the gossip about an old boss’ old boss; the discovery that your new job is someone else’s last job, and that they want to tell you about it; the mystery-flavored taffies and off-brand Lego swag; and the reunions that remind you, no matter how branded the content and corporate the parties, there will always be people who are happy that you could make back for at least one more year.

Because it’s not the marquees that make the mood, but the background music.

# Is being data driven a fad?

*Tell me the odds now, but maybe not next year. *

How much should [Trump Media & Technology Group](https://tmtgcorp.com/), the parent company of Truth Social, be worth?

One way to answer that question is to carefully study its [quarterly filings](https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/83a9acb7-4ada-4a58-97e4-257b49aec76b/a1c1002f-b863-85d9-2d05-522799cdfd56?origin=1), use key performance and operating metrics, like product signups and active users and advertising revenue, to create various mathematical models that forecast its future cash flows, adjust those estimates to account for various probabilistic risks, develop [residual income models](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/residual-income-valuation) and [dividend discount models](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/dividend-discount-model/), and smash it all together into a giant equation full of Greek letters and LaTeX formulas.[^1] And then, just as an astrophysicist can say where Jupiter’s moons will be [in April of 2030](https://europa.nasa.gov/mission/about/), you can say what Trump Media & Technology Group should be worth today. 

A business school professor would probably recommend an approach like this. But Trump Media & Technology Group [would not](https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/83a9acb7-4ada-4a58-97e4-257b49aec76b/a1c1002f-b863-85d9-2d05-522799cdfd56?origin=1):

> Investors should be aware that since its inception, TMTG has not relied on any specific key performance metric to make business or operating decisions. Consequently, it has not been maintaining internal controls and procedures for periodically collecting such information, if any. While many mature industry peers may gather and analyze certain metrics, given the early development stage of the Truth Social platform, TMTG’s management team believes that such metrics are not critical in the near future for the business and operation of the platform. …
> TMTG will consider the relevant key performance indicators for its then-current business operations and determine whether it has effective controls and procedures in place to process information related to the disclosure of key performance indicators and metrics. Should this be the case, TMTG may decide to collect and report such metrics if they are deemed to significantly enhance investors’ understanding of TMTG’s financial condition, cash flows, and other aspects of its financial performance. However, TMTG may find it challenging or cost-prohibitive to implement such effective controls and procedures and may never collect, monitor, or report any or certain key operating metrics. 

In other words: Do not value our business based on models and math and numbers, because we don’t use the numbers, we don’t know the numbers, we don’t track the numbers, and we definitely don’t audit the numbers. This whole company is a bit; you know it’s a bit; we know it’s a bit; and we are required to tell the SEC, in obtuse legalese about risk factors and the cost-prohibitive nature of internal controls and procedures, that it is a bit. It’s a meme that trades on the Nasdaq; it’s a presidential election prediction market; it’s a commemorative collectable coin, sold as a soft con. And you should value it the way you would value those things: By betting on what you think other people will think it’s worth. The answer to what TMTG should be worth isn’t found in a math problem, but in—and only in—our [animal spirits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_spirits_(Keynes)). 

Clearly, the market is using this second method to value TMTG. In the first quarter of 2024, TMTG made $770,500 in revenue, which is, one, about as much as a single McDonald’s location [makes in a quarter](https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/chick-fil-a-makes-more-per-restaurant-than-mcdonalds/320615), and, two, *down* from $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. To bring in that revenue, TMTG spent *$99 million* on operating expenses, for a net profit of negative $98 million.[^2] 

As of this morning, the market values TMTG—a magic box that can, every three months, turn $99 million into $770,500, and *declining*—at $5.93 billion. For comparison, the market values the actual Box.com, which brought in $270 million in revenues, spent $250 million on expenses, and made $20 million of profit, at $4.63 billion. 

It is possible that this phenomenon is unique to TMTG. Maybe TMTG is attracting lots of politically-motivated investors who want to win Donald Trump’s favor by propping up his shell company. Maybe people think that Donald Trump will soon be the president, and he will reward government contracts to Truth Social, or require all federal agencies to post exclusively on Truth Social. Maybe they think [Elon Musk will soon be president](https://x.com/micsolana/status/1846233834519511342), and he will buy Truth Social for Twitter. Maybe the market views TMTG as a crypto token of Donald Trump himself, and maybe that is fun to own.[^3] 

More generally, maybe TMTG is a fad, and it will eventually return to its textbook value.

But maybe not. *Maybe the textbook is the fad*, and the true baseline of what a company should be worth isn’t based on dividends or residual income, but on the collective id. [From Matt Levine:](https://newsletterhunt.com/emails/105810)

> I have written and thought a lot about meme stocks over the last few years, and it has made me a bit nihilistic. [Sometimes](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-08-25/insiders-trade-in-outside-companies) I [suggest](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-01/trump-media-s-business-doesn-t-matter) that perhaps fundamental analysis—the idea that the prices of financial assets reflect the present value of their future cash flows—is a temporary phenomenon; people were trading stocks based on vibes and gamesmanship long before anyone built discounted cash flow models, and perhaps they’ll keep doing so long after. I mostly think of that as a social phenomenon: The available information about companies keeps getting better, but there is no law of nature that forces people to pay attention to that information. You can just buy GameStop because your friends are buying GameStop.

This is both an obvious point—maybe stocks are priced by vibes, and hype, and the general interest that people seem to have in buying stocks—and a profoundly hard one to actually accept. All the money and math has to mean *something*. Sure, maybe there are bouts of irrational exuberance, but there has to be some sort of fundamental bedrock underneath it all, right? It can’t just be a perpetual motion machine of popularity, can it? 

It…could be? It…*probably is*? Different methods for how to value stocks come [in and out of vogue](https://business.columbia.edu/sites/default/files-efs/pubfiles/6208/Valuation%20Models%20Routledge.pdf), and what is widely accepted in one decade can become outdated in the next. Over a longer evolutionary cycle, is it not possible for equity models to move beyond using financial indicators? If the only true anchor for a stock’s price is what other people will pay for it, are vibes a worse measure of its “fundamental value” than recurring revenue?[^4] A company’s [hype factor](https://kellblog.com/2016/03/22/introducing-a-new-saas-metric-the-hype-factor/) may not be a red flag; it might be its only ground truth. 

My brief history of the modern analytics movement goes something like this:

Thirty years ago, people used to make decisions with a little bit of data. They would develop business strategies by looking at monthly sales reports, or roster moves by looking at tables of home runs and RBIs, or trade stocks by playing [connect the dots](https://forextraininggroup.com/basic-principles-of-technical-analysis-in-the-fx-market/) on a line chart. This worked ok.

Then, fifteen or so years ago, a handful of companies, sports teams, and now-celebrities like Nate Silver became very rich and successful by doing more careful analysis. This worked better, in part because they were clever, in part because they were applying these techniques to problems for which data [was particularly useful](https://benn.substack.com/p/day-of-reckoning),[^5] and partly because their competition—other companies, other teams, [pundits hand-counting yard signs](https://peggynoonan.com/monday-morning/)—was immature.

We all saw this, and got very excited. Data became important; “being data-driven” [became urgent](https://hbr.org/2021/06/legacy-companies-need-to-become-more-data-driven-fast). We started trying to quantify and optimize: A/B test everything; [analyze this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS-5L1-7BY4); [analyze that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Liwd6z7UFrY). A cottage industry of content and a booming industry of business applications got built on the idea that everything in the future will become more scientific and more automated. [Data literacy](https://www.amazon.com/Be-Data-Literate-Literacy-Everyone/dp/1789668034) will become as important as actual literacy; [every](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2020/02/14/why-every-company-is-a-data-company/) company [will](https://applydata.io/every-company-is-a-data-company/) become [a](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-every-company-is-a-data-company/) data [company](https://www.datadiligence.com/post/every-company-is-a-data-company). 

And it [kinda didn’t work](https://benn.substack.com/i/142863504/data-is-a-four-letter-word)? Or, at best, the results [have been mixed](https://benn.substack.com/p/just-do-it). There are success stories—Wall Street is [dominated by quant funds](https://www-ft-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/content/f7cb25ba-7329-4291-b7d3-8a34ef84f9f0), for example—but there have also been lots of busts. Increasingly, “we are data-driven” feels less like a competitive advantage, and more like an [empty sales pitch](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/elections/future-forward-kamala-harris-ads.html?campaign_id=9&emc=edit_nn_20241017&instance_id=137064&nl=the-morning&regi_id=52297349&segment_id=180642&user_id=c9acd82e34c2d4495e28bd852647882b).[^6] 

In Silicon Valley—where so much of this began, and maybe where it will end?—you can feel the mood shifting. Though the foil to Paul Graham’s [founder mode](https://www.paulgraham.com/foundermode.html) is manager mode, it could’ve just as easily been data mode. Founder mode is making decisions, moving quickly, being bold, and taking action based on what you know is right; data mode is obsessive measurement, running the experiment longer, being tentative, and abdicating ownership to the numbers. Similarly, today’s folk heroes embody the opposite of data-driven ideals: Elon Musk didn’t optimize Twitter; he went [scorched earth](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/elon-musk-bbc-interview-twitter-intl-hnk/index.html) on it. Sam Altman didn’t [raise $6.6 billion](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-closes-66-billion-funding-haul-valuation-157-billion-with-investment-2024-10-02/) by promising to moneyball a market; he did it by [promising a grand utopia](https://ia.samaltman.com/). And data and technology is no longer eating the world; [taste is](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/taste-is-eating-silicon-valley):

> Just as software ate the world and transformed industries in the last era, taste is now eating software—and with it, Silicon Valley.
> In this new era of Silicon Valley, taste isn’t just an advantage—it’s the future. The most compelling startups will be those that marry great tech with great taste. Even the pursuit of unlocking technological breakthroughs must be done with taste and cultural resonance in mind, not just for the sake of the technology itself. 

None of these loose philosophies are in outright opposition to being data driven, and there aren’t many explicitly data skeptics like [I thought there might be](https://benn.substack.com/p/scoring-data-predictions#:~:text=A%20data%20skeptic%20movement%20emerges.). But there are fashionable alternatives. And the question, I suppose, is if they are just trendy wiggles along our inevitable march towards an increasingly quantified world, or if the whole data-driven thing was the fad.

When we imagine futuristic societies, we tend to picture them wrapped in some space age aesthetic, where everything is automated by giant data-crunching computers. In *Iron Man*, Tony Stark’s Jarvis can [solve international crimes in three minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaP0nbT69bw). In *Star Wars*, C-3PO can calculate [the odds of successfully navigating an asteroid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPB6AlNRRtQ) in real time. In *Star Trek, *the nearly omniscient robot is literally named Data. 

I suspect that these movies, and [hundreds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000) [others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)) [like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(film)) [them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Machina_(film)), are part of why we’re subconsciously attached to the idea that a stock must have a fundamentally sound price, and that the long arc of the universe is bending toward a world run on numbers. If the distant future is Hollywood’s flavor of science fiction*, *the near future probably includes better financial models and more corporate analytics. 

But as Matt Levine suggests, just because the computers can tell us the odds doesn’t mean we have to pay attention to them. Other methods could become more popular. After all, the scene from *Star Wars *isn’t famous because C-3PO knew the odds; it’s famous because Han Solo ignored them.

[^1]: Who are we kidding, it’s in Excel and the entire formula is just [NPV](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/npv-function-8672cb67-2576-4d07-b67b-ac28acf2a568).

[^2]: If a [burn multiple](https://sacks.substack.com/p/the-burn-multiple-51a7e43cb200) under 1 is great, and under 2 is good, over 3 is bad, what’s a burn multiple of *127*? (And even this is too low! Burn multiples aren’t revenue divided by burn, but *added* revenue divided burn. In Q1 of 2023, TMTG made $1.1 million in revenue; in Q1 of 2024, they made $770,000. They spent $99 million in early 2024 to *lose *$330,000 in revenue. So their burn multiple is...negative? Infinity? An asymptote, rocketing into the beyond?)

[^3]: A Horcrux, if you will.

[^4]: Though these things aren’t entirely mutually exclusive. When everyone uses the same financial model to value a company, be it a model about cash flow, or dividends, or [the blockchain](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-27/what-s-in-a-name-u-k-stock-surges-394-on-blockchain-rebrand), or [what people on Reddit think is funny](https://benn.substack.com/p/runaway-train), that model will be correct—not because it reflects any sort of capital-T truth, but because the model will determine the vibes. If we all agree that the best way to value a company is using its discounted cash flow, does discounted cash flow define the “true” value of the company, or does the implicit social agreement about cash flow define it?

[^5]: For example, if you’re looking for undervalued baseball players, there’s a relatively direct way to find them in a database of [12 million Major League Baseball at-bats](https://www.retrosheet.org/). But if you were a fashion company looking to decide what to include in your next season’s collection, data’s a lot less useful.

[^6]: I am sorry, but if you are telling people that you can rank the effectiveness of a political ad “down to a tenth of a percentage point of precision in multiple categories,” you aren’t learning something; you are selling something.

What was remarkable about the [2012 Gizmodo article](https://gizmodo.com/googles-broken-promise-the-end-of-dont-be-evil-5878987) titled “Google’s Broken Promise: The End of ‘Don’t Be Evil’” wasn’t the accusation that Google had done a bad thing; what was remarkable about it was that it too so long for Gizmodo to accuse Google of doing a bad thing.  

Google was founded in 1998. It went public in 2004. [In 2011](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312512025336/d260164d10k.htm#toc260164_11), it employed 32,000 employees, brought in $37 billion in revenue, and made almost $10 billion in profit. By any reasonable measure, it was already the sort of enormous corporate behemoth that people generally assume is evil by default.[^1] But for Google, it took fourteen years of success and attention for “[many to wonder](https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/is-google-now-officially-evil/) if Google has gone bad.”[^2]

There are two ways to think about this. The first is that Google was run by exceptionally good people. They were sitting at the controls of a [staggeringly well-configured machine](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-a-startup-feels), and they had many [evil dials in front of them](https://x.com/dril/status/841892608788041732) that would make them even more money. For Google’s leadership team to avoid the temptation to turn those dials, they must’ve been remarkably benevolent, or at least anti-malevolent. Many companies sell their souls for far less than Google could’ve made by selling a few small pieces of theirs.

The second way to think about it is that Google was an exceptionally good *product*. The people who ran Google weren’t especially moral, and their ambitions to not be evil weren’t especially unique. A lot of people have idealistic visions to do things “the right way” when they start companies; they want to make useful products, to build genuine communities, to create good jobs for employees, to [go high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0abu9A_Outw). Sure, the [lofty promises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8C5sjjhsso) to make the world a better pitch are cringe, but they’re usually bad sales pitches, not outright lies.

Still, a lot of companies end up going low, because building a company is hard. When a company is struggling—when the machine isn’t working, and its survival is hanging in the balance—the dial that does evil looks a lot more appealing. Evil, or at least compromises, starts to feel necessary, and how wrong is it to do what’s necessary? Google avoided that dial because it was making enough money to not need it. When you have a printing press in your basement, you have a lot of leeway in how you can run a company. You don’t need to cheat your users or the law; you don’t need to get in dirty scraps with competitors or the press; you don’t need to make pushy sales calls or entrap customers in subscriptions [they can’t cancel](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/10/federal-trade-commission-announces-final-click-cancel-rule-making-it-easier-consumers-end-recurring). Deep down, Google probably had [the same two values](https://benn.substack.com/p/your-companys-values-will-be-used?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=Most%20for%2Dprofit%20companies%20have%20two%20sets%20of%20values.) that every other company has: First, make money, and second, some other nice sounding stuff, in that order. Google was special because it did such a good enough job of making money that it was able to do the nice stuff too.

Other companies rarely have that luxury. They aren’t evil at birth, run by bad people, or fundamentally better or worse than Google was. But idealism has a price, and most companies can’t afford it.[^3] 

The same logic applies to other things. I don’t believe that most politicians are inherently greasy people. The lower levels of political office aren’t glamorous, powerful, or well-paid, and the many of the people who run for those offices are running with honest intentions. But politics is a dirty business, and [darkness makes monsters of us all](https://benn.substack.com/p/open-the-window?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=darkness%20is%20devouring%20us). In that view, the politicians that stay high aren’t the ones that are morally unimpeachable, or at least *just* morally unimpeachable; they are the ones who are gifted enough to [stay high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu_hCThhzWU). As a politician, Barack Obama was a [generational talent](https://time.com/6087817/barack-obama-documentary-bo/), and his [presidential administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/opinion/i-miss-barack-obama.html?_r=0) was “remarkably scandal-free”—and those two things are related.[^4] 

The point of all of this is that wanting to do something and being able to do it are not the same thing. When something breaks bad—a company, a politician, a dying high school chemistry teacher, an athlete on the margins of the league who decides to take steroids, a blogger who [becomes a shameless hack](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/benn-stancil_how-to-create-a-winning-pitch-deck-activity-7227715595226542080-IKuH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) for the likes—it’s easy to say that they should’ve known better. But they probably *did* know better. Their problem isn’t awareness or will power; their problem is a skill issue, and a system—the league, the market, the economy—that will devour anyone who isn’t elite. 

Someone recently asked me why we sold Mode, a [reluctant BI tool](https://benn.substack.com/p/everything-is-still-bi?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=Internally%2C%20you%E2%80%99ll%20debate%20what%20to%20do.%20Are%20we%20a%20BI%20tool%3F%20Should%20we%20embrace%20it%3F%20You%E2%80%99ll%20ask%20someone%20to%20do%20a%20market%20analysis.%20Or%20should%20we%20go%20back%20to%20our%20roots%3F%20You%E2%80%99ll%20never%20quite%20decide.) that’s core audience was technical data teams who wanted to write code, to ThoughtSpot, an unapologetic BI tool that sold to drag-and-drop enterprise business users. The question wasn’t so much about the decision to sell the business, but about the decision to sell it to a company that did such a seemingly different thing. If our original intention was to make something that let analysts work in the tools they wanted to use—in SQL, in Python, in an monospaced, dark-mode IDE—why did we agree to smash it together with a product that’s explicit goal was to [replace all that stuff](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/28/thoughtspot-hauls-in-248m-series-d-on-1-95b-valuation/#:~:text=The%20company%20wants%20to%20help%20customers%20bring%20speed%20to%20data%20analysis%20by%20answering%20natural%20language%20questions%20about%20the%20data%20without%20having%20to%20understand%20how%20to%20formulate%20a%20SQL%20query.)?

The answer, more or less, is that we weren’t elite enough at what we did. Our initial ambition was to build something specialized—an opinionated power tool; something “[built for analysts](https://web.archive.org/web/20170131205107/https://modeanalytics.com/);” a technical product that was comfortable telling people that you need to be at least this tall to ride this ride. And our first pitch decks laid out a product roadmap that was true to this ideal.

But our ability to keep to that promise was dependent on our ability to build a business around it. Though investors gave us money to make the next great tool for analysts, they really gave us money because they wanted us to eventually give them more money back. If every venture-backed company has two ordered values—make money, and some nice sounding stuff—they also have two unstated product values—build something that you can sell, and build the thing you want to sell. And you have to be good enough at the first one to do the second.

We weren’t quite there. Though we could sell Mode’s product well enough to survive, we couldn’t sell it well enough to be uncompromising on our earliest ideals. Analysts didn’t have big enough budgets; they were too hard to find and too expensive to sell to; they didn’t have enough organizational authority to make their CEO buy the technical tool they wanted over the drag-and-drop enterprise business intelligence tool that the finance team wanted. Perhaps we could’ve made different decisions about what we built or how we marketed and sold it, and we would’ve found our own printing press in the basement. Perhaps the market for the product we wanted to sell simply wasn’t that big. But regardless of the reason, the outcome was the same: The result didn’t match the ambition, and we didn’t earn the right to build something other than a BI tool. So we had to break the glass, and [turn the evil dial](https://mode.com/blog/introducing-mode-as-modern-bi).[^5] 

But there is one important caveat to all of this: Results aren’t measured on an absolute scale. If it takes a one-in-a-billion talent to survive running for president of the United States without breaking bad, then it takes a one-in-a-million talent to survive in the House of Representative, and a one-in-a-thousand talent to do it on the city council of a small town. Similarly, the ambitions that broke [OpenAI’s will to be a non-profit](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-remove-non-profit-control-give-sam-altman-equity-sources-say-2024-09-25/) were bigger and more crushing than the ambitions that [broke Hashicorp’s commitment](https://hackernoon.com/open-source-is-dead-understanding-the-hashicorp-license-controversy) to its open source principles, which were bigger than the ambitions that pressured us into building a data tool that we could sell to people who weren’t just analysts. Though no company can choose its true values—there are always two, in the same order—they can choose the size of the first one, and, by extension, how much pressure it exerts over the second. In our case, there was a business of a different scale, chasing tens of millions of dollars in revenue rather than hundreds of millions, that could’ve outpaced its first value enough to to stay true to its second. 

Anyway, yesterday, Sarah Guo, an investor and the founder of an [AI-focused fund](https://www.conviction.com/), said [now is the time](https://x.com/saranormous/status/1849307805393764642) to chase the biggest ambition you can imagine:

> If you're a founder, this is the moment you dream of. Technical paradigm shifts on this scale come rarely. When they do, they tend to birth a cohort of companies that define the decades that follow. Intel and Microsoft in the 70s and 80s, Cisco in the 80s and 90s, Amazon and Google in the 90s and 2000s, Facebook and Salesforce in the 2000s. And now Nvidia, the three-decade sleeper. Who will be the other giants that emerge from the AI explosion?
> I suspect they will be the companies with a few characteristics: those pursuing the most ambitious visions, those experimenting at the frontier, inventing a new way of interacting with technology, and those companies who recognize what a special moment in time it is. …
> So if you're working on something in AI right now, ask yourself - what's the most ambitious version of this? What will be possible next year? We see too many startups undershoot in their capability predictions. We hope to see more startups overshoot. …
> Tectonic plates that have been slowly shifting are about to collide. Will you be in a position to ride out the quake and build something enduring in its aftermath? If there was ever a time to be maximally ambitious, it's right now. 

On one hand, I get it. Venture capitalists’ make money when they [bet on more big winners](https://andrewchen.com/venture-capital-returns/), not when they bet on fewer losers. And when you're in the thick of working at a startup, pep talks about your potential are nice. Microsoft! Amazon! Facebook! Nvidia! [Steve Jobs!](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/465597-the-man-who-says-he-can-and-the-man-who) The man in the arena! Sometimes, you really do [need to be reminded](https://benn.substack.com/p/getting-away-with-it#:~:text=At%20some%20point%20shortly%20after%20I%20started%20working%20in%20tech%2C%20I%20once%20asked%20a%20coworker%20if%20it%20was%20possible%20for%20us%20to%20build%20some%20part%20of%20a%20website%20in%20a%20particular%20way.%20He%20told%20me%20of%20course%20it%20is%3B%20it%20just%20depends%20on%20how%20much%20time%20we%20want%20to%20spend%20on%20it.%20It%20was%20a%20computer%2C%20he%20said%3B%20we%20can%20make%20whatever%20we%20want.) that you can build whatever you want, and aim however high you want. 

On the other hand, aiming high—which, in Silicon Valley, is often easier to do accidentally than intentionally[^6]—has strings attached. Some of those are well understood: Financial dilution; a gradual loss of corporate control; a [board that might fire you](https://reactionwheel.net/2021/11/your-boards-of-directors-is-probably-going-to-fire-you.html); a [long-term commitment](https://tylerhogge.com/2024/09/27/you-probably-shouldnt-raise-venture-capital/).[^7] But one of the less visible strings is the one that recalibrates your own internal compass. 

Because if you shoot for the stars and land on the moon, that’s great—but the thing that lands on the moon probably doesn’t look like the thing that was shooting for the stars. The open source company becomes one with an aggressive sales team and hated paywalls; the startup that wanted to get rid of management and performance reviews becomes a company with five different levels of senior engineer; the data tool that refuses to call itself a BI tool sells itself to a BI tool. 

Don’t be evil,[^8] absolutely.  But unless a company really is that singular generational giant that emerges from the AI explosion—unless it really are Google—it’s probably going to find itself walking awfully close to the line.

# Fragile

*A week to ignore data.*

![Philadelphia Phillies on X: "GRAND Stott https://t.co/MNtsndC51U" / X](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pphm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8cd4da0-560d-429f-99f1-b016b4e698d7_4096x2523.jpeg)

A wild thing about the United States of America is that, in its 248-year history, no ordinary citizen has ever cast a meaningful vote in a presidential election. [2,220,335,311 times](https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-States-Presidential-Election-Results-1788863), through 59 elections, Americans have traveled to the polls to submit their choice for who will be the next president—and 2,220,335,311 times, that choice has not mattered. Though people have surely swayed elections by [encouraging others to vote](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/08/stacey-abrams-believers-georgia-blue-434985), or by preventing them from doing so, nobody has ever done anything of consequence inside of a voting booth. Never once has that individual decision—to add one more tally to your candidate’s side, the ostensible point of voting—had any point at all. 

An even wilder fact about the United States of America is everyone knows this, and we do it anyway. Nobody drives to the polls because they think the grain of sand that they add to their preferred pile will be the one that makes it weigh more than the pile they don’t like. Probabilities and [big numbers](https://xkcd.com/2091/) are hard to comprehend, but in elections with 150 million voters, twisted through the bizarre machinations of the electoral college, everyone understands the mathematical impossibility of a single vote deciding who becomes president and who does not. 

And yet we vote. Part of it may be a begrudging sense of duty—even if we don’t want them, we sometimes have to eat civic vegetables, because [starving people in China would like to have that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bMP5U3df1I) But that feels too cynical. We vote, I think, because we want to be part of something. We want to participate. Even though our voice may not be the one [that Paul O’Neil hears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2txfHccQrlg), or that [distracts Kevin Durant](https://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=41978221), or that makes [a moment magical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Odd5R0u9xzs), there is something special about standing in the stadium, doing your part. When you’re there, you come to believe in the joyful ruckus of democracy. The very suggestion that our vote does not matter makes us flinch. Even if the numbers say you don’t matter, somehow, some way, you *know* the math is missing something. 

But how fragile is that faith? The moral sense that our vote is important is not an inherent truth about democracy, but a noble lie we tell ourselves because, at least for now, we believe in its possibility. Democratic elections don’t resolve the tragedy of the commons; instead, they create one. We could just as easily treat them the same way we treat the others: As someone else’s problem, in which our involvement is irrelevant. Still, despite the United States’ dark history of disenfranchisement, we’ve stayed in the stadium, and stayed, for the most part, true to the belief that our participation matters. 

Anyway, though this is a blog that is outwardly about data, this is not a week for that. It is neither a week to talk about [how everything is BI](https://hex.tech/blog/introducing-explore/), nor is it a week to do the smug math to figure out how much a vote does or doesn’t matter. Until this election is over, and maybe only until this election is over—an election that I hope Kamala Harris wins, convincingly, that Donald Trump loses, permanently, and that the result is decided, clearly, by the votes and not judges, backroom deals in state legislatures, or Mike Pence having the courage—it is a week for appreciating the arresting magic of a democracy that is believed in. Because it is that spell, and that spell alone, that makes us participate—and it us participating that makes it work.

# No better room

*For better or for worse, the experience of a lifetime. *

---

![Harris will not speak at Howard as election watch party ends on somber note  - The Washington Post](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!efwL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc93459ae-9fb8-45c5-8e9e-c9b9b017dee3_3898x2599.jpeg)
**

We had plans for every contingency. If this data feed failed, a second one was on standby, and a third. If that dashboard broke, there were two more lined up behind it. If there was an error in the spreadsheets, we had scripts ready to fix them. If the automatic scrapers went down, there was a tool for running them manually; if that stopped working, there was another tool for entering data by hand. There were backups, and backups for backups. Countless hours went into building and testing not just Plan A, but also Plan B, and Plan C, all the way down to the plan if the internet stopped working and the power went out: A fully-charged laptop, preloaded with all of our models, locked in a room by itself.

In the end, we didn't need any of it, not even Plan A. The night—election night, from the Harris campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, where I’ve been working the last few months—was over in a matter of hours. The data team that I was part of was tasked with providing the campaign with minute-by-minute, county-by-county, precinct-by-precinct updates about the state of the race. There was a whole floor of us, monitoring everything from the status of the Associated Press’ data pipelines to the Twitter accounts of political influencers in Nevada. And given our opponent’s loose relationship with the law and the electoral will of the people, our assignment was particularly urgent this year.*** ***The better and faster we knew the truth, the better and faster we could counteract [efforts to disregard it](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/05/trump-declare-victory-election). 

But that truth quickly became obvious: We lost, and he won. The minutes and decimal places didn’t matter. Nobody needed our careful analysis or our detailed data to see [which way the wind was blowing](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/politics/presidential-election-2024-red-shift.html). 

Nor did we need our fallbacks or failovers. The thing that the campaign’s engineers and analysts built—very talented engineers and analysts; brutally hard working; and soon, as this campaign winds down, looking for a job; [email me](https://benn.substack.com/about) if you want to hire them—worked, with devastating efficiency. As one analyst said, they were flawlessly delivered disastrous news all night. The engineers’ backups sat quietly on the sidelines, as Plan A unrelentingly pressed forward, squeezing the happiness out of a hopeful room, like a ratchet slowly ticking tighter.

Still. Even if they never made it off the shelf, those backups mean something. They *represent* something. They are the good work of good people, fighting on. The world will never see them, and they will not, in a strict sense, ever matter. Not seeing something, however, is not the same as it not being there. 

—

The first irony of that night, despite our principal job being to document a quickly unfolding catastrophe, is that it was fun. It was a frenzy, an intoxicating cocktail of adrenaline and urgency. So often, professional speed is manufactured. It is mandated by a boss, or self-imposed by our past selves, and by whatever arbitrary due date we once logged in a Jira ticket. They do not make movies about people hitting corporate deadlines, because nobody really cares about corporate deadlines. 

But on Tuesday night, the urgency was real. The engineering infrastructure *had* to stay up. The analysis *had* to be done, at a breakneck pace. Hundreds of data pipelines fed into predictive models about millions of voters, feeding data to dozens of analysts within minutes of those results being published on thousands of county precinct websites—and our mandate was to figure out what it’s telling us before anyone else did. Tell the campaign if it’s winning or losing; tell it how to respond. Tell it that its forecasts underestimated rural support, or overestimated how much mail-in ballots cannibalized election day turnout. Find something important, and your discovery could, without hyperbole, be quoted on CNN fifteen minutes later. 

You are supported by every resource that the campaign can muster, are studying a problem that the world is watching, have access to more data on the election and the electorate than everyone from Nate Silver or the *New York Times. *And your one job is to figure out what is happening, because the President of the United States wants to know. Never before have I been involved in trying to answer a more pressing question for a more important audience—and never before has the answer been worse. 

—

The second irony of that night is that, had we won, there was no room I’d rather be in. We would’ve been the center of a national party; we would’ve known, moments before everyone else, that that [highest and hardest of glass ceilings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZNWYqDU948&t=663s) had been broken; and I would’ve been surrounded by the people who broke it.

But had we lost, there was also no room I’d rather be in. If we are [entering a dark time](https://time.com/7173617/kamala-harris-concession-speech-full-transcript/#:~:text=I%20know%20many%20people%20feel%20like%20we%20are%20entering%20a%20dark%20time), the handful of weeks I spent in Wilmington will not have made it any lighter. In many ways, I was a tourist on the campaign—here briefly, working on the edges. Other people worked here for much longer, on much more critical things. But for the short time I was here—and for those few hours on Tuesday night—we were all in the war room together. It was not enough, nor was it, in the long arc of a campaign, critical work. As the veterans say, our most important job is to earn more votes; everything else is a distant second. In that moment, though, we were doing all that we could do. And knowing that will matter to me.

So, if you are worried about what’s coming next—do something. If you are mad—do something. And sure, do something because it might make a difference; because it might make a dent; because [a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1071-never-doubt-that-a-small-group-of-thoughtful-committed-citizens). It might, if you are better at this than I was. 

But also, do something because it is easier to lose on the field than in the stands. As a spectator to a spiraling election, the despair is hollow; you are helpless to [stop everything from unraveling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LebrzDtQn_s) in its final innings. Though we were ultimately just watching election returns like everyone else—this year, [the cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat) was dead, quite dead, and all we did was open the box to find out—from the inside, you see just how furious the fight is to keep it alive. And while that doesn’t change the result, it changes you.

—

The best way to spend four hours in Wilmington, Delaware, the joke goes, is to spend the first thirty minutes driving to Philadelphia. I can’t pretend that there’s not some truth to that. It is bleak here, like an old mall in a shrinking suburb. But for the last eighteen months, on a few floors in a faceless downtown coworking space, there was a bit of magic. There was a growing team of people, putting in more hours than any other job would ask of them, for a fraction of the financial benefits they could make elsewhere, trying—truly, [without exaggeration or embellishment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8C5sjjhsso)—to make the world a better one. 

But they will never be celebrated, because we lost. Their work will remain unknown, because the postmortems about this campaign will be about what we did wrong and not about what they did right. They will not be seen, but that does not mean they haven’t been here. 

They are good people, fighting on. And in three years, they will be hiring again.

# Does data quality matter?

*Garbage in; whatever, it’s fine.*

---

![The Weeknd Joins Travis Scott For Four Songs In Australia - SPIN](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!k1cO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff86c4a41-b8c6-43f7-a0c4-4843c0c641a5_1668x1112.jpeg)

An obvious thing that often happens is that, whenever the world changes in some significant way, companies will say that it is very good for them, actually. In 2020, when the Covid shut everything down, lots of software businesses said stuff like, “in these trying times, collaborative task management software is more critical than ever.” When the economy took off in 2021, and investors on Wall Street and Silicon Valley put a huge premium on growth, those same companies said that “collaborative task management software will make sure your team can ship their transformative new initiatives as fast as possible.” Then, after the [good times died](https://www.businessinsider.com/europes-investors-advising-portfolio-companies-ahead-impending-recession-2022-12) in 2023, they said “in [years of efficiency](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-year-of-efficiency/), collaborative task management software helps you do more with less.”

Of course, some of these might be true, but they can’t *all* be true. If low interest rates and a booming stock market are the ideal circumstances for buying collaborative task management software, high interest rates and a stagnant stock market can’t also be the best time to buy collaborative task management software. But, collaborative task management software vendors will always want to sell you collaborative task management software, so they will always tell you that there’s never been a better time to buy it. And it’s usually not too hard to come up with a plausible reason why thing X is good for situation Y, for just about any X and Y you can think of.[^1] 

Sometimes these reasons sound more compelling than others. “Ah ha,” a company that sold a business intelligence application might’ve said in 2022, “analytics software is valuable when you need to find ways to grow quickly, but being data-driven is even more critical when you’re optimizing your margins to be more profitable.” Sounds right; [was wrong](https://benn.substack.com/p/dont-be-evil#:~:text=We%20weren%E2%80%99t%20quite%20there.%20Though%20we%20could%20sell%20Mode%E2%80%99s%20product%20well%20enough%20to%20survive%2C%20we%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20sell%20it%20well%20enough%20to%20be%20uncompromising%20on%20our%20earliest%20ideals.). 

Anyway, now, that new thing is AI. "In the age of AI," every CEO says on LinkedIn née content marketer says in a corporate blog née billboard says in an actual overt advertisement, "you’ll get left behind if you don’t buy our stuff.” Recruiting services, a new CRM, a data streaming platform, a vaguely scammy online writing class—all of it is more urgent than ever, according to the people who sell recruiting services, new CRMs, data streaming platforms, and vaguely scammy online writing classes. 

Most of the time, we don’t think about this much, because the motivations are so transparent. Of course [Microsoft would say](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/19/microsoft-brings-together-its-enterprise-ai-offerings-in-the-azure-ai-foundry/) that Azure’s new unified application platform is exactly what businesses need to “harness the full potential of AI efficiently and effectively.”[^2] It would be weird if they didn’t say that. 

But sometimes, we don’t think about these sorts of pitches because they seem so transparently *true*. One of those claims—made not just by vendors, but also often present in more ostensibly objective blog posts and presentation preambles, and treated as obvious and indisputable—is that data quality is becoming more important than ever. In the age of AI, the story goes, the companies with the best models will win; the best models will be built on the best data; the best data is, at least in part, the highest quality data. If you have “bad” data, your models will be bad, your chatbots will give bad answers, your employees will make bad decisions, and you will go out of business.[^3] Garbage in, garbage out; sounds right. But is it? 

# Math, ish

Loosely speaking, companies collect data for two reasons: To help them make strategic decisions, and to help them make operational decisions. Strategic decisions come from reporting—say, “we make 80 percent of our money selling shoes”—and analysis of that reporting—“people leave a lot of shoes in their online shopping carts, and maybe we should send them some emails to remind them about that.” Operational decisions are the often automated ones that carry out a strategic decision—“every morning, at 9:15 am in their local time zone, send people who have shoes in their shopping cart an email with a big picture of those shoes.”

Neither of these things work very well if the data they’re built on top of bad data. If you don’t track what people leave in their shopping carts, you’ll never know that they’re full of shoes. If you have missing data because your Android app doesn’t record what people put in their carts, you won’t email people shopping on their phones. If your data is messy and takes too long to clean up, you might email people after they’ve decided to buy shoes from some other store. If a bug mixes up which shoes a customer has in their cart, you’ll remind them to buy the wrong pair, and they will be confused or upset. This is all well understood, so much so that you can make jokes about it on billboards in San Francisco, and [people will laugh about it](https://x.com/awwstn/status/1115404217219289088).

Today, people collect data for a (still hypothetical but much hyped) third reason: To train, tune, or be available to some AI model. The shoe store needs product catalog data so that their customer support chatbot can be informed about all of the latest products that are in stock. It needs to know demographic information about its customers, so that it can write custom marketing copy for each user when they land on a product page.[^4] It needs to ingest all of its customers’ reviews into a giant vector database so that procurement managers can “chat with virtual customers,” and figure out which styles of shoes to stock next season. 

In some cases, these sorts of problems are no different than what we do with data today; they’re just operational decisions, where the decision is made by an LLM rather than a series of if-this-then-that heuristics. They need accurate data, sure, but no more or less than anyone already does today.

But for the other cases—for the “transformative” ones, in which data is used to train some model, or build some AI agent—data quality actually seems to matter *less*? 

Very roughly, bad data can throw a wrench in today’s analytical gears because most analysis is done with math. Math is useful, but it has a problem: One wrong number can mess everything up. The sum of nine correct data points and one incorrect data point is wrong; the average of 999 accurate numbers and one inaccurate one is wrong. The revenue you report to the SEC can be undone by one bad number; the effect of an A/B test can get inverted if a few data points get dropped. That’s the blessing and curse of math, I suppose: Every aggregation is a precise summarization of every piece underneath it. 

To me, the most useful way to think about an LLM is as [aggregation functions for text](https://benn.substack.com/p/avg-text) (or images, or videos, or whatever). It is a way to combine a bunch of previously unsummable data into something that acts like an average: Average the [news](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24293993/particle-news-app-ai-summaries); average my [email](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UslnMhBLHGA); average [every Drake and The Weeknd song](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/19/arts/music/ai-drake-the-weeknd-fake.html). 

But they’re very loose averages. If you told [Suno](https://suno.com/), an AI music generator, to make a mashup of Drake and The Weeknd and left out a few of their [worst songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJeY-FXidDQ), or even mistakenly threw in a few of Travis Scott’s, you’d still probably get something pretty similar to “[Heart on My Sleeve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_on_My_Sleeve_(Ghostwriter977_song)).” 

More importantly though, *you probably wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.* Whereas an analyst can dutifully double and triple check their math to make sure that their figures are correct, or they can determine precisely how some missing numbers warped their final results, an AI DJ can’t. There are no “correct” averages of songs; there is no way to audit “Heart on My Sleeve” to know whether “[Fein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9synWjqBn8)” was mistakenly included in its input data or not.[^5]  

In other words, the approximate qualitative averages that get built by these models bulldoze bad data in ways careful mathematical computations do not. Which isn’t to say that better data doesn’t make a better model—I’m sure it does—but it means the connection is at least somewhat indirect, and that a lot of generative AI models, including the best ones in the world, are pretty durable to bad data.[^6] Copilot, a code writing model, is trained on [code in public Github repositories](https://github.com/features/copilot#faq), some of which are meticulously maintained by professional developers and some of which are the [confused midnight wanderings](https://github.com/bstancil/vote_machine/commits/master/) of a desperate [pretenginner](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-analytics-pretendgineer?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=as%20opposed%20to%20me%2C%20a%20pretengineer%2C%20a%20benngineer). ChatGPT is [trained on Reddit](https://qz.com/openai-reddit-chatgpt-chatbot-training-ai-1851484007), which is not a clean corpus of text, in any sense of the word. Midjourney is trained on [100 million images](https://www.diyphotography.net/midjourney-used-hundred-million-images-without-permission-to-train-is-ai/), which likely includes both well-cataloged Ansel Adams photos and a bunch of badly labeled pictures dredged up from the depths of Instagram. And perhaps most tellingly, AI companies commonly use this point—that there is a fuzzy connection between what goes into a model and what comes out—as a legal defense against copyright claims. Another way to phrase [OpenAI’s response](https://openai.com/index/openai-and-journalism/) to *New York Times’* [lawsuit against them](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-much-is-the-news-worth)—that “models learn from the enormous aggregate of human knowledge” so “any single data source - including The New York Times - is not significant for the model’s intended learning”—is to say that no individual data source really matters, including bad and messy ones.

All of which raises the question—if data teams’ bleating about the dangers of bad data haven’t been listened to before, why would they be listened to now? You can imagine the conversation: A CEO says they want to train some fancy model to create an [immersive commerce experience](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/10/09/walmart-reveals-plan-for-scaling-artificial-intelligence-generative-ai-augmented-reality-and-immersive-commerce-experiences), because “a standard search bar is no longer the fastest path to purchase, rather we must use technology to adapt to customers’ individual preferences and needs.” The data team says, “Ok, but it is critical that we invest in robust data quality solutions, so that we can build the best models.” The CEO then says, “We have a [profit margin of 2.7 percent](https://s201.q4cdn.com/262069030/files/doc_earnings/2025/q3/presentation/Earnings-Presentation-FY25-Q3.pdf). How will I know that this additional investment in data quality will make us more money?” And the data team says, “Ah, well, you see, no single source is significant for the model’s intended learning.”

Which is not a very good answer? And it’s certainly a much worse answer than saying “we need to invest in robust data quality solutions, so that you can correctly report how much money we make and don’t [get sued by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190).” So why would data quality matter more now?

# Vibes

There may be one reason. Even if AI models aren’t fully undone by bad data—even if you can make a popular song on a messy catalog of songs, or build a good immersive shopping experience on an incomplete event stream of customer behaviors—something about that *feels* wrong. It’s one thing to intellectually understand that the best software [should have some bugs](https://world.hey.com/dhh/software-has-bugs-this-is-normal-26d5fd06), and that you’re [wasting time](https://www.wired.com/story/jordan-ellenburg/) if you never miss a flight. But it’s another thing to actually tolerate the bugs, and to miss the flights. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it—but if it is broke, a lot of us get twitchy. 

We haven’t gotten twitchy about broken dashboards because, frankly, people don’t get twitchy about broken things that they don’t care about.[^7] And if nothing else, people seem to care about AI. CEOs are excited about it. Everyone is [jealous of Nvidia](https://companiesmarketcap.com/). There is a [party full of rich people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby), and nobody wants to miss it. 

If data quality matters more now than it did before, it seems like that will be the reason why: Not because AI models care more about higher quality data than traditional reporting, but because, at least during the current AI circus, businesses care more about AI models than they ever did about reporting. And that, I’m sure plenty of software companies will say, is a big change that is very good for data quality, actually.

[^1]: But not all of them! In early 2020, a friend of mine was teaching bridge 1) to seniors 2) in giant enclosed conference rooms 3) *on cruise ships*. Quite hard to spin a global pandemic as being good for that business, I’m afraid.

[^4]: This will be a thing, right? Someone will go to look at a pair of shoes, and rather than the [website saying](https://www.tiktok.com/@bentonmcclintock/video/7392015229044935966) that they “call to simplicity through their archetypal shape, and their matte leather is contrasting with the shine of the lacquer, giving them a strong and timeless presence,” it’ll identify them as the type who’s insecure about their height and will instead say “these shoes have 4 inch heels and we promise [nobody will be able to tell](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/10/31/desantis-boots-shoemakers-00121044).”

And that’s sort of the point. If you can’t tell what the inputs are, can we really say it’s important for all of those inputs to meet some high standard of quality?

[^6]: You could probably even make the argument that some messy data is *good*. [As OpenAI’s Andrej Karpathy said](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1733299213503787018), a bit of randomness is a feature of LLMs, not a bug. It is our disjointed and idiosyncratic experiences that make us creative; it is the imperfect training data in an LLM that makes it more than a mechanical search engine.

[^7]: Consider, for example, the oddity of the entire data contract debate. If data teams need people to *sign actual contracts *so that they’ll be motivated to give us good data—good data that we are supposed to manufacture into something useful and give back to them—how valuable can that thing that we’re making really be? You only need hall monitors when nobody believes that the rules actually matter.

*[allegedly](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/800140-every-block-of-stone-has-a-statue-inside-it-and)*

Fifteen years ago, I worked at a think tank in Washington, DC. I spent most of my time writing [a weekly newsletter](https://carnegieendowment.org/people/bennett-stancil?lang=en) about the global economy, and each article followed the same audacious formula: a few charts, 1,400 words, and a couple concluding recommendations for how to solve [some](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2010/08/time-to-get-us-immigration-reform-right?lang=en) [major](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2011/11/implications-of-rising-inequality-in-emerging-markets) [worldwide](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2010/06/europes-second-banking-crisis?lang=en) [crisis](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2010/02/is-a-sovereign-debt-crisis-looming?lang=en).[^1]

In theory, our work was affecting real change—we were talking about meaningful problems, not trying to get people to [click more ads](https://www.fastcompany.com/3008436/why-data-god-jeffrey-hammerbacher-left-facebook-found-cloudera). In reality, the newsletter, which went out to a few thousand Hill staffers, government agency officials, other think tank mill hands, and my parents, only affected that change through a long series of highly dubious dependencies:

If nothing we wrote ever made it past step three—and I doubt anything did—was our work a waste of money? On one hand, yes, obviously. Our job was to help policy makers make better decisions, and we couldn’t do that if the most we ever did was fill some unread “Daily Pulse” brief, the unplugged controller that a mid-level State Department staffer gave to a nepotistic intern to keep them busy for a summer.

On the other hand, the articles, and the hundreds just like them that dozens of other think tanks dumped out every day, served a greater good. They were the set behind the real actors. Our work—the incessant churn of “expert” commentary and analysis—was necessary to backstop the influential stars who carry every think tank’s brand: The former [Fed chairman](https://www.brookings.edu/people/ben-s-bernanke/), the [presidential candidate](https://carnegieendowment.org/people/john-kerry?lang=en), the [senior global policy maker](https://www.piie.com/experts/senior-research-staff/olivier-blanchard), the [Nobel prize winner](https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/jstiglitz). Those people skip all the steps that doomed our newsletter, and instead just have dinner with senators and White House advisors. But they need job titles to maintain their positions of influence; no CNN producer wants their chyron to introduce Anderson Cooper’s next guest as “unemployed.” So they work at think tanks, the think tanks buoy their legitimacy with dozens of newsletters and research papers and afternoon policy luncheons, and they give think tanks their famous headliners.

So did our work *matter*? Sort of. It had to be a convincing imitation. We were background characters, costumes, b-roll. The theatrics of the stars wouldn’t work without us, but nobody was really paying attention to us either.

The world is probably full of jobs like this. They aren’t useless, because a movie needs props. But they aren’t the things that they pretend to be. They are the bricks in a [false front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_false_front_architecture): Collectively convincing from a distance, but bearing little meaningful weight of their own.

# Lord Business

There are other examples. Almost exactly a year ago, *Futurism* accused *Sports Illustrated*, a former premier print magazine and now an online brand [that hot potatoes itself](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/19/1239387627/sports-illustrated-will-continue-its-print-edition-under-a-new-publisher) between minor media conglomerates and second-tier PE firms,[^3] of [publishing AI-generated articles](https://futurism.com/sports-illustrated-ai-generated-writers) under AI-generated bylines. *Sports Illustrated*’s publisher, The Arena Group, gave a lukewarm defense: They said that the articles were written by a third-party contractor called AdVon Commerce, and that AdVon “assured” them that the articles were written by humans, but some “writers use a pen or pseudo name in certain articles to protect author privacy.” Notably, neither *Sports Illustrated* nor The Arena Group defended the [content of the articles](https://web.archive.org/web/20221004090814/https://www.si.com/review/full-size-volleyball/), which were, you know, weird:

> **Play Like A Pro With The Best Full-Size Volleyballs**By Drew Ortiz
> Volleyball is one of the most popular sports in the world, and for good reason. It’s fast-paced, has a high skill ceiling, and is generally an exciting sport to both play and watch. Even people who don’t watch sports can easily understand the intensity and skill required to play volleyball whenever they watch clips. There’s a reason why it’s been such a mainstay in modern sports to this day. Volleyball can be a little tricky to get into, especially without an actual ball to practice with. You’ll have to drill in the fundamentals in your head before you can really play the game the way it was meant to be played, and for that, you’ll need a dedicated space to practice and a full-sized volleyball. However, finding a good volleyball can be tough. Luckily for you, we’ve found some of the best full-sized volleyballs in 2022 that are perfect for practicing your serves and sets every day.

One way to read this sort of scandal, which has been [repeated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/08/31/gannett-ai-written-stories-high-school-sports/) by other [publications](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/25/tech/cnet-ai-tool-news-stories/index.html), is that the publishers are short-sighted [Lords of Business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUfCMsCe5BA) who rather glue together cheap prefab SEO chum than pay real writers for their creativity and culture. Which, yes, clearly; you do not outsource supposed journalism to a company called AdVon Commerce* *unless you only care about advertisements and commerce.

But another way to read the scandal—and in particular, The Arena Group’s unwillingness to even bother defending its [unsettling sales pitches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U4-KZSoe6g) for “full-sized volleyballs”—is that the artists are overvaluing their art. Surely, *Sports Illustrated* knew articles like these are terrible; their bet, it seems, is that it doesn’t matter if they are. Beat writing and daily commentary about locker room drama is, like the articles I wrote for the think tank, theater; it is the artificial hustle and bustle necessary to make a sports website feel alive enough that its central stars—a few prime time talking heads and influential podcasters—appear to be in the middle of something popular. The leads’ art matters, and the rest is just set design: a façade that only needs to be peripherally believable.[^4]

For The Arena Group and publishers like it, the point may not be to use AI to replace journalists, nor is AI up to the ideal version of the job that journalists are supposed to do; the point is that the journalists’ work doesn’t matter to their business all that much anyway. All the publisher needs is someone to churn out superficially useful busywork and SEO bait. Historically, you couldn’t create that without paying people to do proper journalism and to create interesting art; now, publishers might be able to buy the former without being burdening themselves with the latter.

In other words, if AI replaces all our jobs, it might not because because what we do is easy, or because AI is so good that it can do as well as we do. It may be because it never mattered if we were particularly good at it in the first place.

# “Previously unimagined insight”

One of the themes of this blog is that a lot of the analytics industry may be unwittingly playing the same part as *Sports Illustrated*’s beat writers or as the think tank content farm. We are a stage behind the main show—and in our case, we are a piece of the edifice of executive competence. We give certain CEOs a way to convince people of something [they want to do anyway](https://benn.substack.com/p/tilt-and-tilted); we give [uncertain CEOs](https://benn.substack.com/p/does-data-make-us-cowards) a way to say a bad decision [isn’t their fault](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-important-thing-for-you-to-know). We give companies a way to market themselves as having [some winning competitive edge](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-data-driven-companies-win). But a lot of that work is spectacle—the data [isn’t that valuable](https://benn.substack.com/p/day-of-reckoning); the results [are tilted](https://benn.substack.com/p/a-better-way-to-lie-with-statistics); the decisions [are emotional](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-emotionally-informed-company); the job [is a fad](https://benn.substack.com/p/is-being-data-driven-a-fad). AI may replace us, not because [a bot can do real analysis](https://benn.substack.com/p/playing-for-ourselves), but because [we never could do real analysis](https://benn.substack.com/p/just-do-it) either, and it never mattered all that much if we did.

There are exceptions, of course; some companies are quite good at analysis and [building operational engines](https://benn.substack.com/p/data-arithmetic) on top of data organizations. But those are not the norm. Instead, the core narrative that motivates our existence—give us data, and [we will find you insight](https://benn.substack.com/p/insight-industrial-complex)—is storycraft, written by us, and perpetuated by the executives and software vendors who have made being oh-so-data-driven a central part of their own brand. And perhaps it is time to [get rid of the whole thing](https://benn.substack.com/p/disband-the-analytics-team).

But it is Thanksgiving, and today seems like a rude time to write yet another one of those rants. Maybe my cynicism about our usefulness is a projection. Maybe analysis isn’t all that hard; maybe it’s just hard *for me*. Maybe there are thousands of examples of analytics delivering on its promise of finding [previously unimagined insights](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/previously-unimagined-insights.png). Maybe *I* am the exception, and those stories are, in fact, the norm.

# What truth is out there?

A few months after ThoughtSpot bought Mode, ThoughtSpot’s marketing team proposed that I start a podcast. They had been running [a successful one for a few years](https://www.thoughtspot.com/data-chief/podcast), and, after I joined the company, suddenly found themselves needing to babysit a new employee who, once again, [had a job and no useful skills](https://benn.substack.com/p/a-brief-programming-note?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=With%20a%20non,without%20a%20job.). In 2013, those who can’t, start a blog; in 2023, those who can’t, start a podcast.

The early idea—which never materialized; [oops](https://benn.substack.com/p/oops?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=First%2C%20oops.%20Second%2C%20for%20the%20sake%20of%20my%20career%20prospects%20after%20I%20return%20from%20spending%20more%20time%20with%20my%20family%2C)[^5]—was an extension of the [only data podcast I’ve ever really wanted](https://x.com/bennstancil/status/1421225199157002245): One in which people tell stories about the interesting things they learned about how the world works while working with data. Most data podcasts or interview programs are centered around their guests' resumes. People are invited on because they have big titles at important companies; they’re asked about their careers and accomplishments; they are mined for actionable advice and hot takes.

I wanted (want?) a show that talks about interesting problems. A lot of data people are drawn to the industry because they started looking at the numbers behind some hobby or interest—sports, food, politics, fashion, movies, science, whatever. It was the domain that drew them in, not the career path. But once we’re here, we end up talking about the axes that we use, rather than the gold that we were initially eager to find.[^6]

So, in the spirit of that podcast, in the spirit of general holiday cheer, gratitude, and [hearts growing three sizes some days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGSs33DQ1F0), and, most importantly, in the spirit of giving this whole analytics and insights thing one more real shot, I would love to know, from you: Is analytics real? Are there examples of times when the narrative of what an analyst is “supposed” to do—ask a question, analyze data, poke and prod and slice and dice and drill, until something profound emerges from the noise, when the [angel is set free from the stone](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1161553-i-saw-the-angel-in-the-marble-and-carved-until). I’m less interested in stories about generic impact—”we ran some tests and boosted signup rates by four percent!”—or of operational refinement—”we used to call people at random and now we score them with red, yellow, and green dots!”—and more interested in true discoveries—”we used to evaluate players based on their batting average, and we built a championship team [by using on-base percentage instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MjxoaynCmk).”

We sell this promise all the time. We dream of it as our final destination, once we’re done with building operational infrastructure, cleaning up messy data, and democratizing data exploration. It is [our original inspiration](https://web.archive.org/web/20170210192210/https://www.periscopedata.com/about#:~:text=when%20a%20blip%20in%20the%20data%20makes%20you%20say%2C%20%22wait%20a%20minute%E2%80%A6%22) and our greatest value. And I’m not convinced it’s real.

But hey, maybe I’m wrong. If I am, please tell me.[^7] [For the greater good. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm--inJtnc4&t=127s)

[Please, convince me this is real](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdg588mWp6Fvu8wvqxZkQm3TzsExncQ70E-b6g1v5D6vu2pg/viewform)

[^3]: This is the history of *Sports Illustrated*’s ownership, I think: Before 2018, it was owned by Time, Inc. When Time sold to Meredith Corporation, a media conglomerate, *Sports Illustrated* was sold to Authentic Brands Group, a brand management company that was owned by CVC Capital Partners, a private equity firm, and HPS Investment Partners, a private debt investor. The *Sports Illustrated* brand was licensed to The Arena Group, a brand holding company that is somehow public, despite making forty-five *thousand *dollars [in revenue](https://investors.thearenagroup.net/node/11621/html) last quarter. After the Arena Group[ missed a licensing payment](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/business/sports-illustrated-magazine.html) earlier this year—which, uh, yeah—*Sports Illustrated* was sold to Minute Media, another media brand holding company, which is owned by a former venture capitalist and private equity investor. Fun.

[^4]: Look, I’m not saying I want this to be true. It’s depressing to imagine that half of ESPN’s writers are employed to be extras on Stephen A. Smith’s stage. But it also seems somewhat plausible that half of ESPN’s writers are exactly that.

I’m not sure I can ever say I’d be proud to start a podcast, but I might’ve been proud to start a podcast called “I’m only here so I won’t get fired” that got cancelled because I got fired.

[^6]: Of course, this stuff is hard to talk about, because it’s not often public information. I’m not sure how you deal with that, though it seems like there would surely be a way. If nothing else, things stay interesting a lot longer than they need to stay secret.

# Postgres in a box

*The next big thing.*

---

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cS_v!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaa7f23d-76db-459c-812a-f1408660f808_612x367.png)

Sometime between now and, I don’t know, 2027, someone is going to go on stage at a [Y Combinator demo day](https://www.ycombinator.com/demoday) and pitch a company that sells copies of Postgres in a box.

I mean, no, they won't literally pitch that. Postgres is an open-source database; it is 28 years old; it is free. And nobody sells software in little cardboard boxes anymore, unless you're doing a [marketing stunt](https://www.y2k.movie/) for [geriatric millennials](https://x.com/_hex_tech/status/1715489502154944917/photo/2).

Because we *used* to sell software in boxes. In 1998, if you wanted the new version of *StarCraft*—or, like, [Microsoft Access 97](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-access/97), but I did not want that when I was 12—you went to CompUSA and bought a seemingly empty cereal box for $49.99.[^1] Then you went home, spent a couple hours trying to install the game on your Gateway 2000 cow computer, and played it until the [computer imploded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW7Rqwwth84), or until IGN told you that there was a [new expansion pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft:_Brood_War) that you had to have. In the second case, you then went back to CompUSA; you bought another almost empty cardboard box for another $49.99, spent another three fraught hours installing the game, and then played the new version, until you got frustrated about losing,[^2] or your parents told you that you were out of computer time, or whatever.

Companies did the exact same thing, but instead of buying *StarCraft*, they bought [Oracle 8i databases](https://www.orafaq.com/wiki/Oracle_8i), paid $100,000 for them, and [spent 13 years](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-107012#:~:text=Certain%20installations%20of%20operating%20system%20software%20had%20reached%20end%2Dof%2Dlife%20over%2013%20years%20ago.) installing them. And if the upgrades broke, they didn’t lose their progress in a game; they lost their customers and their money and their jobs and sometimes [go to jail](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/01/crowdstrike-accused-of-defrauding-investors-in-class-action-lawsuit).[^3] It was much more fraught, for them.

But the internet—the information superhighway, back then—started to change all that. Rather than buying their Oracle 8i databases from a software store, companies could buy a *license* for their databases. They would download the database from the internet; no CDs or boxes required. You still had to buy a new database when [Oracle 9i](https://www.orafaq.com/wiki/Oracle_9i) came out though, and upgrades were still slow and difficult.

And then came the cloud and SaaS software.[^4] Instead of buying a program, downloading it on your own computer, and [running it into oblivion](https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/10/boeing_747_floppy_drive_updates_walkthrough/), you buy a subscription to use someone else’s computer. They run and update the software, and you pay them a recurring fee. Don’t install Excel; go to google dot sheets dot com,[^5] and Google will run it Excel-ish for you.

By 2012, you could do the same thing for your database. That year, Amazon [released Redshift](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/future-of-the-modern-data-stack#:~:text=When%20Fishtown%20Analytics,its%20historic%20importance.), the first major SaaS database. You bought a subscription to Redshift, paid a monthly fee based on database specs you wanted, and Amazon would run it for you, on their computers, on your behalf. And when Amazon released a new version of Redshift, they would give you the upgrade automatically, without you having to do or pay anything.

This was much better than CompUSA! Not only was it much less of a hassle to manage, it was also ostensibly cheaper. You didn’t have to buy a bunch of IBM servers to run it on. You didn’t have to pay a big upfront fee for new database versions. You just paid a flat monthly rate, and you got a ticket to an all-you-can-eat buffet at Amazon’s database bar.[^6]

But this introduced some new problems. Back then, databases typically had two interlocking components—a big bucket that they stored data in, and a calculator that would perform computations on that data. Though running that calculator was expensive, storage was cheap (for example, you could buy a two-terabyte hard drive for about $100 [in 2012](https://jcmit.net/diskprice.htm)). However, when you rented a database from Amazon, the two were bundled; your bills were determined by how much data you *put in* your database. If you had small data, you could rent a small Redshift database, and pay a small fee. But if you had Big Data—and [what were you even doing](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/big-data-the-next-frontier-for-innovation) if you didn’t have Big Data—you had to rent a Big Database, and pay a Big Fee. Wouldn’t it be better, we all thought, if you could store your data in one place, and then only pay for the [small amounts of data](https://motherduck.com/blog/big-data-is-dead/) that you *use*? That way, you could size each component separately: You could buy a big bucket for your big data, and a small calculator for your small calculations.

So that’s what databases did. They split themselves in half; they “separated storage from compute,” as the catchphrase goes. With databases like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks, customers paid two fees: one (typically low) rate for how much data was in the database, and a metered charge for how many computations they asked the database to do on that data.

And then [all](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2021/11/02/databricks-sets-official-data-warehousing-performance-record.html) the [databases](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/industry-benchmarks-and-competing-with-integrity/) went to [war](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2021/11/15/snowflake-claims-similar-price-performance-to-databricks-but-not-so-fast.html). The database market is a big one—Larry Ellison became the [third-richest person in the world](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/) selling them—and everyone wanted their companies to become Oracle, so that they could become Larry Ellison. To make their database better than everyone else’s database, database vendors built a bunch of bells and whistles on top of their fancy calculators. Databricks could run Python. Snowflake uses AI. [DuckDB is chill](https://duckdb.org/2022/05/04/friendlier-sql.html#trailing-commas) about [commas](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-case-against-sql-formatting).[^7]

Which created yet another new problem: What if a customer wanted *multiple* calculators? What if I want to use Python today, AI tomorrow, and be loose with commas on Friday nights? Though different vendors separate how they bill for storage and compute, you still have to buy them as a bundle. You can’t put your data in one place, and bring your favorite calculator to it.

Or, you couldn’t—but now that is changing too. Earlier this year, Databricks [bought Tabular](https://benn.substack.com/i/145645344/attention-numbers). Tabular was founded by the creators of Iceberg, which is an open-source standard for turning data in buckets into tables for calculators. The deal, [according to Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/blog/databricks-tabular), was about promoting “data interoperability:”

> This acquisition highlights our commitment to open formats and open source data in the cloud, helping ensure that companies are in control of their data and free from the lock-in created by proprietary vendor-owned formats.

In other words, if you store your data in a particular way—in this case, using Iceberg—you can put it in whatever bucket you want, and Databricks’ big calculator can read from it.[^8] And two days ago, [Amazon announced](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-s3-tables-apache-iceberg-tables-analytics-workloads/) they would support the inverse: If you put your data in S3—a generic bucket for stuff, almost literally—they will automatically store it for you in the particular way that Databricks wants it:

> Amazon S3 Tables deliver the first cloud object store with built-in Apache Iceberg support, and the easiest way to store tabular data at scale. S3 Tables are specifically optimized for analytics workloads, resulting in up to 3x faster query throughput and up to 10x higher transactions per second compared to self-managed tables. With S3 Tables support for the Apache Iceberg standard, your tabular data can be easily queried by popular AWS and third-party query engines.

Which is, for Big Data, a [Big Deal](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ian-whitestone_aws-dropped-a-huge-announcement-yesterday-activity-7270114894190911488-tz2U/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):

> Open data formats and data lakes have been all the rage over the past year. Many companies want to keep their data in their Cloud Storage provider [ like Amazon ] and make it accessible to multiple services/query engines [ like Databricks ].
> AWS coming out and adding first class support for Parquet/Iceberg will lay down the foundations for this trend to accelerate.

But why stop there? Tristan Handy, CEO of dbt Labs, [says the stool needs more legs](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/summit-season):

> Low-friction workload portability doesn’t happen automatically just because you have an open file format, table format, and metastore. From what I can tell, in order to make this a reality, you need:

That is—sure, while all of this Iceberg stuff is great, it’s not enough. The ideal database would not only separate buckets and calculators, but it would also *separate the calculators from the programs that people want to run on them*.

Because, today, in order to use multiple calculators, you have to write programs in multiple languages. Every database engine has different APIs and uses a different variants of SQL, and all the queries and pipelines and applications built on that engine need to use that variant.[^9] You can’t simply point a query that was originally written for Databricks at a Snowflake or a DuckDB engine, because there are [very](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/datediff) stupid [differences](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/functions/datediff.html) between all [three](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/date.html#date_diffpart-startdate-enddate) of them.[^10] Even if the calculators are interoperable with the buckets, the programs are not interoperable with the calculators.

So that seems like what’s next—[dbt directly on top of S3](https://benn.substack.com/p/what-happened-to-the-data-warehouse), more or less. You write queries in one language, like [dbt SQL](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/recovering-from-the-party#:~:text=dbt%E2%80%99s%20cross%2Dplatform%20capabilities%2C%20and%20its%20support%20for%20open%20table%20formats%2C%20is%20still%20in%20its%20early%20days.%20I%20fully%20expect%20this%20to%20a%20major%20area%20of%20innovation%20for%20us%20in%20the%20coming%20years%20as%20the%20entire%20ecosystem%20is%20reshaped%20around%20this%20new%20set%20of%20standards.) or [SDF SQL](https://blog.sdf.com/p/announcing-sdf-general-availability#:~:text=Ultimately%2C%20SDF%E2%80%99s%20vision%20is%20to%20enable%20execution%20of%20the%20same%20query%20against%20proprietary%20compute%20providers%20(like%20Snowflake%2C%20BigQuery%2C%20and%20Redshift)%20and%20SDF%20DB%3B%20with%20both%20query%20engines%20yielding%20the%20same%20result.), and it gets rewritten in whatever version of SQL a specific execution engine prefers. The programs and pipelines people write would then be agnostic to the calculators underneath them—which would then, as Tristan proposes, make it possible for people to choose the right engine for the right job.

And then, *then*, we would have the ideal database.

Which, yes! Except:

For all of the nice things that this build-a-bear database can do, there’s a lot to sell against here. And if there’s something people don’t want, then there’s something else [people want](https://paulgraham.com/good.html), and an inevitable pitch to YC:

> Hi, I’m Taylor, and I’m the CEO of Databox, the all-in-one database platform. The modern enterprise needs data more than ever, but using* *data has never been harder. My founders and I have seen this problem firsthand—at Waterloo, where we both majored in [System Design Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/systems-design-engineering), and then when we worked on data engineering teams at Google, and Brex. We created Databox to build the database we always wanted: One where you can just upload your data to one platform, and it stores it for you, without you having to worry about which S3 bucket it’s in, or how to reformat your CSVs in Parquet. We abstract away all of that tedious complexity, and let our customers think about everything in Databox as “tables”—an intuitive new format of easily readable rows and columns that we open-sourced two weeks ago, and already has 400 stars on GitHub.
> Once your data is in Databox, you can interact with it using one unified language, which we call the Proprietary Operating System Transpiler, which Generalizes Really Every Single Query Language, or PostgreSQL. Databox will automatically optimize your PostgreSQL queries by choosing the best engine for each of them, without you having to configure anything.
> Finally, the only thing harder than using today’s databases is figuring out how much they cost. Which is why we are launching with a revolutionary billing plan: We bill you once, for a perpetual lifetime license, and you can use Databox as much as you want, for as long as you want. No variable costs; no surprise charges. The only time we’ll ever ask for more money is if you want to upgrade your Databox account to include our latest features.
> I’m Taylor, and we’re reinventing the database. And this…is Databox.

I mean, ok, it’s not Postgres in a box. But isn’t it?

# Postgres in a Box

Speaking of, this week, Aaron Levie launched Postgres in a Box, but [called it Box AI](https://x.com/levie/status/1864127432107938175):

> The vast majority of an enterprise’s data is unstructured data, with enterprise content being the most significant portion of this. Some of the world’s most important IP lives inside of this content — our contracts, financial documents, digital assets, movie scripts, R&D files, product specs, HR documents, and more. …
> However, the majority of this content has tremendous amounts of untapped value for most organizations. For all of our *structured* data that lives inside of a database, we can query this information easily, summarize it, analyze it, pull out insights, and more. But for all of our unstructured data, this has been nearly impossible. In fact, in many cases the more content we have the harder it is to work with and less valuable it becomes.
> In this new era of AI, this all is reversed. What if you could ask all your content any question you want, or automate any of the workflow instantly. All new ways of working with information become possible: “What’s our best performing product line?”, “How many contracts have risky terms in them?”, “Which clients do we have promotional rights to?”, “Show me all my open invoices”. All of a sudden, the more information we have the more valuable it becomes. We can innovate more and accelerate progress.
> Now, enterprises are still in the earliest stages of beginning to leverage AI on their unstructured data, but with Box AI we’re building the platform to make this easy, secure, and scalable for any use-case. And we’re doing so with an open approach, to bring the power of any AI model into Box AI so customers can leverage whatever works best. That’s the power of intelligent content management from Box.

We’ve [talked](https://benn.substack.com/p/avg-text) about [this](https://benn.substack.com/p/attn-data) a [lot](https://benn.substack.com/i/152026526/math-ish): When we think about the difference between structured spreadsheets of numbers and loose PDFs of sales call transcripts, we often act as though the former has inherently more validity than the latter. It is math; it is science; it is “statistically significant.” Interviews and conversations and product specs are anecdotes, corrupted by emotions and biases.

As Levie implies, that might not be the right distinction to make. Data is still downstream of emotions and biases; a quantitative survey of 10,000 people is [no less corruptible](https://benn.substack.com/p/tilt-and-tilted) than a qualitative interview panel of 10 people. The difference between the two is that, when the data is numbers, “we can query this information easily, summarize it, analyze it, pull out insights, and more.” We can’t average words, or put a where clause on a [giant file of traffic camera photos](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/nyregion/brian-thompson-uhc-shooting-suspect-search.html#:~:text=One%20of%20investigators%E2%80%99%20main%20goals%20continues%20to%20be%20finding%20an%20image%20of%20the%20suspect%20in%20which%20his%20face%20is%20entirely%20visible%2C%20said%20the%20official%2C%20who%20described%20the%20man%20as%20extremely%20camera%2Dsavvy.%20Even%20in%20the%20pictures%20released%20on%20Thursday%2C%20he%20is%20wearing%20a%20hood.).[^11] But if we could query and aggregate words and images the way we can aggregate numbers—if we could put a calculator on top of a bucket of text files—we might find that unstructured data is both more valuable and easier to analyze than our venerated spreadsheets. From this blog, [last year](https://benn.substack.com/p/avg-text?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=Though%20the%20raw,it%20at%20once):

> Though the raw material in that Dropbox file is probably more valuable than the raw material in your Databricks database, we can’t easily mine or manipulate it; we can only sample it. That’s why we instinctively dismiss this sort of information as untrustworthy or biased: Not because it’s wrong, but because there’s no way to look at all of it at once.

That is where all this is going, I suppose: Box puts an LLM query engine on top of their files, and Box (and Dropbox, and Google Drive) become three more components in the ideal database for the modern enterprise. And then, in 2029, someone pitches OneBox, to disrupt Databox, by putting Postgres and Box in a box.

# Pink Pilates Princess Hollywood Pop

What is the point of hiring an analytics team? There are at least two answers:

The first one sounds nice, but the second one is [probably what people want](https://benn.substack.com/p/insight-industrial-complex#:~:text=aren%E2%80%99t%20looking%20for,insight%3B%20it%E2%80%99s%20distortion.):

> [ People ] aren’t looking for complicated and fancy analyses; they usually just want to know what’s happening. The value a data team provides is making that information available. We rarely need to figure anything else out, or obscure these basic facts behind a [Daily Readiness Score](https://store.google.com/us/magazine/fitbit_daily_readiness_score). More often than not, this isn’t insight; it’s distortion.

Anyway, this week was Spotify Wrapped week—“‘All of my friends say it is like my Super Bowl,’ said Ms. Brown, 23”—and [the youths are upset](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/style/spotify-wrapped-2024.html):

> Ms. Brown is part of a vocal cohort of Spotify’s 640 million users who typically share their Wrapped results proudly, but this year she and many others found that new features generated by artificial intelligence — such as a podcast about their listening habits and word-salad-like summaries of their favorite genres — fell flat. …
> A new feature of Spotify Wrapped this year is Your Musical Evolution, which aims to reveal up to three musical phases that Spotify says “uniquely defined your year.”
> Users received phases with largely confounding names, including “Pink Pilates Princess Roller Skating Pop,” “After Hours Football Rap” and “Cinnamon Softcore Art Deco,” paired with the artists whose music had inspired those terms.
> The feature was widely mocked on social media, with one Reddit user commenting that the titles were “random words tossed together.”

What did she want instead? Just to know what’s happening:

> She also questioned the accuracy of users’ top songs lists.
> Some other social media users lamented the loss of information such as a user’s top genre for the year, as well as the Sound Towns that sought to geolocate a user’s music tastes.

Yes, right, if you are Spotify, it is tempting to create fancy new insights, like “Your favorite genre of music in June is [Pink Pilates Princess Hollywood Pop](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wrapped.png),”[^12] because there’s no way something as simple a 80-character SQL query—`SELECT genre, COUNT(*) FROM plays WHERE user_id = 'me' GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC`—will go viral. But that [really is all we want](https://x.com/contrarianbimbo/status/1864384673889309000).

[^1]: There was a CD in the box, and some bits of paper that you did not read. Though at some point, it became a literal empty box, and all that was inside was a code that let you download the game from the internet. And by then, it cost $59.99.

[^2]: Of course, the best way to play *StarCraft* was to plant yourself in a corner and [build up and build up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpcxfsjIIbM&t=54s) until you had 50 siege tanks that[ slowly inched into your enemy’s base](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGHEtJXQFp4). This was obviously a dope strategy, it obviously never worked, and it was probably why I got frustrated about losing all the time.

[^3]: This is a joke; it’s a civil suit; nobody from CrowdStrike is going to jail. But they are getting sued for securities fraud because of a [bad software update](https://www.wired.com/story/crowdstrike-outage-update-windows/). And man, it is bad when your software outage not only has its [own Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages#Impact), but that page also has an “Impact” section with separate subsections for air transport, finance, government, ground transport, healthcare, media and communications, and retail.

[^4]: I still don’t know how to [say this](https://benn.substack.com/p/data-contracts#footnote-3-74606196). Just SaaS? SaaS software? Software-as-a-service software? What?

[^5]: Not a real website, unfortunately. What a missed opportunity for [sheets.com](https://www.sheets.com/).

[^6]: Technically, this isn’t quite true. Redshift launched with [two options](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2013/02/14/amazon-redshift-available-to-all-customers/): A flat annual rate, and a per-hour rate. But the per-hour rate was like a hotel bill. You paid for how long you wanted to reserve the database, not for how much you used the database—that is, you booked a room, and the hotel didn’t charge you more or less based on how much time you spent in it. Since databases are typically long-lived applications, most people did not spin databases up and down all the time.

[^7]: No, I kid, all of them run Python and use AI and do a bunch of other things. There are genuine differences between databases, but they are technical and esoteric, and probably matter less than [being chill about code formatting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7PLxL8jIl8) like commas.

[^8]: Is it strange for Databricks to show its commitment to getting rid of proprietary vendor-owned formats by [buying a quarter of the committee](https://projects.apache.org/committee.html?iceberg) that’s building the leading alternative to proprietary vendor-owned formats? We [must own it](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/technology/dot-org-private-equity-battle.html) to protect it, as it reaches “[new levels of growth and innovation](https://web.archive.org/web/20200109223404/https://www.keypointsabout.org/blog/strengthening-org-for-the-future),” I guess.

[^9]: It would be more fun if we called them varietals. I prefer a 2017 SQL to a 2023 SQL. I prefer a California SQL. I prefer a full-bodied SQL. I prefer my SQL from a [cardboard box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franzia).

[^10]: To recap: Snowflake uses `datediff`, which takes three inputs: A time duration, like day or month, a start date, and an end date. DuckDB’s equivalent function takes the same inputs, but is called `date_diff`. And Databricks uses `datediff` like Snowflake, but their version can only compute how many days separate the two dates, and the function expects the end date *first*, and the start date second. Outstanding.

[^11]: Me, every time I see [someone on a Citi Bike now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGqZz5DyDSQ).

[^12]: Which is apparently different from Pink Pilates Princess Roller Skating Pop?

*[The answer is blowin’ in the wind.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMFj8uDubsE)*

A while back, Dan Luu [wrote a blog post](https://danluu.com/p95-skill/) that periodically [makes the rounds](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&query=https%3A%2F%2Fdanluu.com%2Fp95-skill%2F&sort=byPopularity&type=story) in Silicon Valley. It begins:

> Reaching 95%-ile [ in most skills and activities ] isn't very impressive because it's not that hard to do.

And continues:

> Personally, in every activity I've participated in where it's possible to get a rough percentile ranking, people who are 95%-ile constantly make mistakes that seem like they should be easy to observe and correct. "Real world" activities typically can't be reduced to a percentile rating, but achieving what appears to be a similar level of proficiency seems similarly easy.

His point is not that nothing is hard. It’s that, to get reasonably good at most things, all you need to do is put in a moderate amount of intentional practice, and very few people do that. People might commit time to the thing—learning a game, giving talks, writing, whatever—but they’re typically passive players, fumbling through without stopping to ask what mistakes they’re making and how they can fix them. Often, according to Dan, the distance between a novice and an apparent expert isn’t a gulf of skill and 10,000 hours, but a few hours a week of effort and an active intention to improve.

I have a theory that there's also a startling amount of distance between people who are merely very good at something, and people who are truly great—except, this gap is vast. Staggeringly, arrestingly, hopelessly, inhumanly vast.

Nate, a former coworker of mine, is a horrifyingly good runner.[^1] He ran the 2023 New York City marathon in a disgusting [two hours and 37 minutes](https://results.nyrr.org/event/M2023/result/733), running a six-minute-mile 26 miles in row. The winner, Tamirat Tola, ran it in under [two hours and five minutes](https://results.nyrr.org/event/M2023/result/4), pacing at 4:46 per mile, beating Nate by 74 seconds per mile.

Nate is a far, *far *better runner than just anybody any of us know. And Tola demolished him. If Nate, Tola, and the world’s fastest mile runner, Hicham El Guerrouj, had raced for the first mile of the marathon, Tola would’ve finished closer to El Guerrouj—who once ran a mile in 3:43—than Nate would’ve been to Tola. And Tola maintained that gap for 26 straight miles. It’s incomprehensible, what it takes to run that fast for that long.

Olympic decathletes run the 1500 meters in about [four minutes and 15 seconds](https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/results/athletics/men-s-decathlon/1500--------).

James Sprague, the [current world Crossfit champion](https://games.crossfit.com/athlete/900251), a 210-pound barrel of muscle, can clean and jerk 340 pounds. That ties the world record for that lift—[for women who weigh 155 pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_records_in_Olympic_weightlifting).

Obviously, this is imprecise, and the distribution of expertise can’t be quantified by any single number or plotted on a single graph. But if it could, it seems like it would be shaped like backwards L: The slope of the curve would be nearly flat, and then nearly vertical. For almost its entire span, it is a shallow hill that most of us can climb, if we put in a bit of effort. And then, it is a cliff, straight up. And lots of people are hopelessly stalled at the bottom, perhaps better than 95 percent of the world, but a mile below the world’s best. Because, even when great climbers think a cliff looks impossible to scale, there will be somebody who can go [straight up it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urRVZ4SW7WU).

# A career in science

So here’s my question, then:[^3] If you work in data, what cliff are you climbing?

Some people may want to be experts in tools. They want to know every data observability tool on the market; they want to get a Google alert when someone mentions “reinventing business intelligence” on Product Hunt. Their mountaintop is being the illuminati behind the Magic Quadrant, or to be [Marques Brownlee](https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee) in a blazer, a company t-shirt, and corporate [dress sneakers](https://x.com/dieworkwear/status/1659670275393458176).

Some people might want to be experts in technologies. They read ArXiv abstracts about vector databases, and dream of rebuilding Postgres in [Rust](https://turso.tech/blog/introducing-limbo-a-complete-rewrite-of-sqlite-in-rust), for [Iceberg](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/crunchy-data-warehouse-postgres-with-iceberg-for-high-performance-analytics), in a [box](https://benn.substack.com/p/postgres-in-a-box). For them, data is incidental; the interesting thing is the computer that processes it.

Some people are here for the techniques. They work in data to talk about [Nick Felton’s ](http://feltron.com/FAR14.html)*[Annual Report](http://feltron.com/FAR14.html) and *how to represent uncertainty in a chart, because they love data visualizations; they work here to debate causal inference, because they are statisticians; they care about data modeling methods, because they are Ralph Kimball.

But most of us, I suspect, are some undecided fourth thing. We are practitioners of these other three things, but unpracticed in them; we aren’t, as Dan Luu instructs us to, actively trying to become great technologists or statisticians. Instead, we drift among them, and define ourselves as analytical generalists, or, even more atmospherically, as “data people.” We would probably say that we are good at critical reasoning, are rigorous and quantitative, are [always curious and question the status quo](https://careers.walmart.com/corporate/data-analytics-and-business-intelligence). We are passable programmers and statisticians, and experts in “analytical thinking.”

No doubt, that is a potentially useful intersection of talents.[^4] You can build a career out of this sort of resume, and lots of people have. But I’m starting to think—which, [s](https://benn.substack.com/p/searching-for-insight)[h](https://benn.substack.com/p/is-being-data-driven-a-fad)[o](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-analytics-pretendgineer)[c](https://benn.substack.com/p/disband-the-analytics-team)[k](https://benn.substack.com/p/just-do-it)[e](https://benn.substack.com/p/insight-industrial-complex)[r](https://benn.substack.com/p/day-of-reckoning)—that it’s a career with a low ceiling.

Pursuing a career in analytics feels like pursuing a career in “science”—it’s not specific enough to go anywhere. Yes, there is a loose set of attributes that all scientists have; they are empirical, skeptical, observant, and structured.[^5] And yes, there are noble jobs that are generically scientific, like teachers and educators, and there are approximate parallels in analytics, like team managers and mentors. There are also mercenary jobs in both—“influencers,” mostly, who seem more interested in [talking about the thing](https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab/) than [doing the thing](https://benn.website/). But there are not experts in science. Science is what you take in fifth grade, not what you win a Nobel Prize for.

The analytics discipline may well be the same: A [general set of skills](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/data-expertise-everywhere), and a survey course that you’re supposed to start in but not the career you’re supposed to finish in.

# Everything nowhere all at once

Whenever we raised money for Mode, I used to have this bit about how the work that analysts do is inherently viral. You don’t create charts or do analysis for its own sake, I’d say; you do it because you want to share it with someone else.[^6] 

That is the optimistic way to look at analytics, I suppose—as a nerve center, infiltrating its way into everything. But the pitch has another implication, which is that analysts can’t stand on their own. To paraphrase an analogy a reader sent me, analytics is a dust devil. It is invisible on its own; we only know it’s there when it [blows something around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qssvnjj5Moo). You cannot see the wind without something for it to disturb; you cannot be an analyst without something to analyze. Otherwise, it is just a verb in search of a subject.

Another reader put it this way:

> …the domain you're talking about is *the analytics industry*. I don’t know what that is… I have a clue, though—the framing necessarily means that the domain is secondary to the tool. Given that, I wonder if it can be defined as "analysis of data in fields where it's not in the critical path to revenue/purpose". Because when it is, it's usually baked into our understanding of the domain—econ, bio, transportation planning, policy research, etc.

It’s a subtly searing criticism of what so many of us do. It suggests that there are lots of analysts out there who don’t have to constantly [elbow people](https://wrongbutuseful.substack.com/p/elbows-of-data) to [get their attention](https://davidsj.substack.com/p/dear-stakeholder), but they call themselves something else—like quant traders, pollsters, CFOs, and [general managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Beane). And they got there by specializing: They committed themselves to finance, or political opinion polling, or baseball, and found their principle identity in that instead of under the vague umbrella of “data.”

Without that, we seem doomed to have almost definitionally peripheral careers. We are fact checkers, not authors; we are logical mechanics, not drivers. We are junior executives, bouncing from one director or VP role to the next, always given the same task of “building a team and a culture.” A few years ago, I thought that the way to [get off this treadmill](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-missing-analytics-executive) was to craft a better role for the executive analyst. But now I’m not so sure. [If we want to do something more important, we have to do something more important.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbllP2FOvEE)

Which means, I suspect, choosing to a cliff to climb. We can’t just be analysts or analytics engineers; we have to decide that we want to be true experts in understanding how to build consumer software first, and product analysts second. Or define ourselves as working in finance, then become an analytics engineer at a fintech company. Because there’s a corollary to Dan Luu’s theory of expertise: While it implies that we can become pretty good at stuff pretty quickly, it also implies that other people can become pretty good analysts. And in almost every field, that combination—a domain expert, and 95th percentile analyst—is almost always better than the inverse.

That’s ok, if that’s we’re happy on the edges. But if not—if people are antsy, reaching middle age in an industry entering its adolescence—we probably can’t get away with being good at “asking questions.” We need to know some specific things too. Otherwise, we risk being like the wind—everywhere, but nowhere in particular.

Since I’ve started this blog, I’ve asked people to answer six questions:

Lots of you filled out these surveys, but I only told you what [one of them said](https://benn.substack.com/i/66244589/reader-mailbag-are-companies-profitable) (the fifth one, about making money). So, at some point in the next couple weeks, this blog is going to turn into [a 2004 Bill Simmons column](https://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/050810), and there will be a mailbag episode about the other five.

And, in the spirit of a true mailbag post, if you have any other questions you want to ask, [the mailbox is open](http://benn.gripe/).[^7]

*Is OpenAI a wrapper around ChatGPT?*

If you're a distressed data startup—the fifth maker of an [accidental BI tool](https://benn.substack.com/p/everything-is-still-bi), the fourth-biggest data observability platform, a data catalog that’s been through three pivots and two bridge rounds—you probably have a spreadsheet of companies that might acquire you. Some of the names on it are the megacorporations you said you were going to disrupt; some of them are competitors;[^1] some of them are prehistoric conglomerates—Infor, Pentaho, ZoomInfo, Quest—that are collectively labeled “Legacy” or “Tier 3” or “the Borg.”

Inevitably, Amazon is also on your list, as a Tier 1 target. They have [75 billion dollars](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001018724/03ade3d0-6805-4d85-9580-5f1ac303b66b.html#) in cash under their mattress, they’re a prestige buyer,[^2] and *it just makes sense*. They make the [world’s best bare computing metal](https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/), but offer only a handful of [basic](https://www.amazon.com/stores/AmazonBasics/AmazonBasics/page/947C6949-CF8E-4BD3-914A-B411DD3E4433) applications on top of it. QuickSight, Amazon’s half-hearted attempt to build a BI tool, hasn’t bothered to make a new product video in almost six years.[^3] CloudWatch, a tool for monitoring AWS logs, [is of the devil](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/9sz0i9/cloudwatch_is_of_the_devil_but_i_must_use_it/). Redshift is a has-been; Athena is a never-was. Acquisitions are all about adding one plus one to get three. Amazon already sells billions in data infrastructure platforms; imagine how much more they could sell if they paired it with your G2-leading, Product Hunt-delighting Data Discovery Platform for the Modern Business Cloud™.

Just as inevitably, they’re not going to do that. No matter how cozy you get with their corporate development team, Amazon won’t buy your data discovery platform. They don’t care about your passionate set of 150 customers; to them, the equation is not 1 + 1 = 3; it’s 1 billion + 1 = still 1 billion, basically. And while it *seems* like cloud providers like Amazon would want to put some snazzy apps on top of their lower-level computing services to entice people to buy those services from them and not Google, they [don’t need to do that either](https://erikbern.com/2021/11/30/storm-in-the-stratosphere-how-the-cloud-will-be-reshuffled):

I’d add a third point to Erik’s list: The cloud providers’ competitive advantage in cloud computing is enormous. AWS isn’t just good software; it’s [200 data centers](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/), each costing billions of dollars to build.[^4] [Microsoft built 300](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure). [Google’s data centers](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations) are connected by “more than 3.2 million kilometers of terrestrial and subsea fiber.” These companies’ moats aren’t their amusing UIs and [oh-so-relatable](https://benn.substack.com/p/we-dont-need-another-sql-chatbot#footnote-2-134863380) brands; they are literal moats, dug into the Oregon bedrock and Pacific Ocean seafloor. With or without your data discovery platform, they will all be fine.

But another company on your acquisition list is Databricks. They probably won’t save you either—when [hundreds of modern data stack startups](https://www.moderndatastack.xyz/companies) are [running out of money](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/reflections-and-predictions#:~:text=I%20have%20personally%20gotten%20half%20a%20dozen%20inbounds%20from%20companies%20looking%20for%20M%26A%20outcomes%20just%20over%20the%20past%20month%20or%20two), the one [with 10 billion dollars](https://www.databricks.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/databricks-raising-10b-series-j-investment-62b-valuation) is probably getting a lot of casual calls from founders who just thought it might be a good time to catch up—but they *might*. Because, unlike Amazon, Databricks’ nucleus isn’t a half-trillion dollars worth of buildings and computers and wires; it’s a [free database](https://spark.apache.org/). From the *Wall Street Journal, *[reporting on](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ali-ghodsi-databricks-ceo-ai-4a1043aa) Databricks’ recent fundraise:

> In January 2016, Ghodsi succeeded Stoica [ as Databricks’ CEO], who returned to academia. At the time, Databricks charged for a more user-friendly version of Spark [ an open-source data processing engine, akin to a database ] but was struggling to find large customers who would pay for it. Many were still downloading the software free off the internet.
> The challenge became clear when a potential customer asked Ghodsi and another co-founder for a selfie before a meeting. When the pair later asked whether he would be willing to pay $10,000 for the software, the customer scoffed. “Why would we ever pay $10,000?” he said. “I’m just going to get it for free.”
> Under Ghodsi, Databricks added new features to Spark that were only available to the startup’s paying customers. He then hired hundreds of salespeople to sell it to companies, targeting business giants like Capital One and JPMorgan.

Which, yes, of course—when the thing you’re selling is free software, you build a bunch of special things on top of it that make it better, easier, and more blinged out. If the thing you are selling is access to [a nuclear submarine full of computers](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/sustainability/project-natick-underwater-datacenter/), you don’t need to do any of that. You cannot download a nuclear submarine from the internet.

Anyway, here’s a question I’ve wondered for a while: Which one is OpenAI?

There are arguments for both. It’s like Amazon: While OpenAI isn’t selling its customers access to data centers ([yet](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-24/openai-pitched-white-house-on-unprecedented-data-center-buildout)), it is selling access to a proprietary model that they’ve spent billions of dollars creating. No, it’s like Databricks: People can download ([almost](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmarena-ai/chatbot-arena-leaderboard)) that model [for free off the internet](https://www.llama.com/). Actually, it’s still like Amazon: Even if the model is free, you need a bunch of [really expensive computers](https://modal.com/blog/nvidia-h100-price-article) to run it, and those computers are [notoriously hard to buy](https://fortune.com/2024/11/21/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-blackwell/). Which makes it Databricks: The companies that are like Amazon [are the ones leasing servers](https://lambdalabs.com/) full of those computers, and OpenAI is just a fancy application running free software on top of other people’s rented computers.

My guess is that both sides are right; it just depends on when you ask the question. Initially, OpenAI was Amazon: They were the sole gatekeepers to an incredibly popular service that had lots of imitators, but none of them, least of all the free ones, were convincing replacements. A [server rack in a garage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a2lv4IwZFY) is not the same as a [2 billion space station](https://news.microsoft.com/stories/microsoft-datacenter-tour/); the [early Alpaca models](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) were noticeably worse than the leading ones from OpenAI.

But it seems like that gap is collapsing. The current models are [potentially plateauing](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-rivals-seek-new-path-smarter-ai-current-methods-hit-limitations-2024-11-11/), and it’s becoming more and more expensive for OpenAI to take smaller and smaller steps forward. And there is [no longer an obvious way to play defense](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-ai-companies-work#:~:text=What%2C%20then%2C%20is%20an%20LLM%20vendor%E2%80%99s%20moat%3F):

> What, then, is an LLM vendor’s moat? Brand? Inertia? A better set of applications built on top of their core models? An ever-growing bonfire of cash that keeps its models [a nose ahead](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bHKPQGHSqqE) of a hundred competitors?

This morning, [OpenAI finished up](https://openai.com/12-days/) the “12 Days of OpenAI,” a two-week launch blitz in which they released a new feature for twelve straight weekdays.[^5] One was a [new model](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/20/openai-announces-new-o3-model/), of sorts;[^6] a handful of them were updates to underlying models, but most of them were, to use the slur that we’d use if anyone else built them, wrappers around ChatGPT: There were multiple integrations with iOS and Apple’s desktop apps; there was a way to call ChatGPT on a telephone; there was [Canvas](https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/), a document editor with shortcuts that ask ChatGPT to suggest edits, to make sections shorter or longer, and to add, [repulsively](https://benn.substack.com/p/delirium?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=ornery%20as%20before.-,I%20still%20hate%20emojis,-%2C%20and%20would%20rather), emojis; there was [Projects](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10169521-using-projects-in-chatgpt), which are folders for your Canvases.

I have no idea how much OpenAI cares about these features. Maybe they’re demo apps, meant to show other companies what OpenAI wants them to build on top of ChatGPT. Maybe they’re hack day projects that got shotgunned out the door for the sake of a Christmas carol. Maybe they’re part of no plan at all, and what happens when you give a bunch of engineers [18 billion dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/openai-raises-6-6b-and-is-now-valued-at-157b/) and tell them to make a [simple chatbot UI better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4vvBidQcck&t=895s).

Still, it’s hard not to wonder if some of these features, especially the now-ubiquitous Notion aesthetic—a minimalist pageless word processor; a few preset font and style options; a left sidebar of “pages” or “projects” or “collections” or some other shapeless noun that unnecessarily rebrands “folders” and “documents;” emojis, again—are the first few foxholes in OpenAI’s ultimate moat: A better set of applications built on top of their core models. Or, more precisely, these features are ways to make models more convenient to access and ergonomic to use. OpenAI can no longer just entice us with foundational infrastructure and an [accidentally successful chat app](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24318650/chatgpt-openai-history-two-year-anniversary); they’re now trying to sell us commoditized tech and an increasingly complicated SaaS app.[^7]

Consider the arc of AI-powered coding assistants. The first popular one was GitHub Copilot, which was built on a [heavily modified version of an early OpenAI model](https://github.com/features/copilot#:~:text=What%20data%20has%20GitHub%20Copilot%20been%20trained%20on%3F). Then, Cognition’s Devin, a coding environment combined [with a custom model](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/a-peter-thiel-backed-ai-startup-cognition-labs-seeks-2-billion-valuation-998fa39d?ref=maginative.com#:~:text=Devin%20was%20trained%20using%20AI%20models%20from%20OpenAI%2C%20in%20which%20Founders%20Fund%20is%20also%20an%20investor.), was trendy. Now, it’s [Cursor](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/in-just-4-months-ai-coding-assistant-cursor-raised-another-100m-at-a-2-5b-valuation-led-by-thrive-sources-say/), which is much [more of a SaaS app than AI model](https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-cursor/):

> …the problem to solve is not how to make LLMs perform well in isolation, but how to make them perform well alongside a human developer.
> We believe, therefore, the interface between programmers and AI models will soon become one of the most important pieces of the dev stack. …
> Cursor is a fork of VS Code that’s heavily customized for AI-assisted programming. It works with all the latest LLMs and supports the full VS Code plugin ecosystem. What makes Cursor special are the features designed to integrate AI into developer workflows.

In other words, people want the better software product, not the better model. Which is ironic, I suppose. Silicon Valley has spent the last two years trying to figure out which AI companies are real, and which are just wrappers around ChatGPT. In the end, though, the wrappers may be the only thing that matters—even for OpenAI.

Or, alternatively, here is my proposal for Sam Altman:

I mean, step 3 is probably fraud, and step 4 would be hard for a company with [several dozen subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=openai&type=communities&cId=cfa69671-70f6-4d0f-8e6b-33e06a992850&iId=fbf28873-edf0-4e3e-a43b-0ed0ab48cef0) dedicated to it. And even if you put those aside, I’m sure that some people would say, no, no, this would never work; people would notice. ChatGPT is the best model, and OpenAI is on track to make [11.6 billion dollars](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-sees-11-6-billion-001354946.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADuds8c0-KI4rnyfBaRISJapw3XWtDIHXxd-kYkvum8uFSjVyABbf1xjSL8Pa2bLd4QyIshh0icxQaQxysiDKpPjbwI3z1ky4tzhFDe005FMJnLYqii54TzdetLlmZM5EERYBCem6h2Hw0GKrFwh3uFM2OPJDq5Yv8AVMhjAT1u3) next year because people want to use the best model.

Except—ChatGPT might not [be the best model](https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard). Satya Nadella, who might [own OpenAI](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-10-21/who-owns-openai), said that leading models [aren’t all that essential anyway](https://x.com/SouthernValue95/status/1867339940159533419).[^8] And if [nobody can tell the difference](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-did-you-do-on-the-ai-art-turing) between human paintings and AI paintings, I’m skeptical that many people can tell if their book report on *The Great Gatsby* was written by GPT-4o or Gemini 1.5 Flash.

Instead, it seems much more likely that OpenAI is going to make 11.6 billion dollars because ChatGPT is popular. It became synonymous with AI, the leading company that no CIO gets fired for buying, and the website that every high schooler has bookmarked. It’s going to make 11.6 billion dollars because it’s got the best *brand*. Two years ago, people’s enthusiasm for OpenAI’s brand was built on their enthusiasm for OpenAI’s products. Now, the brand leads, and the product—which is getting awfully expensive to build—follows.

So how do you keep the brand without burning billions to build an undifferentiated product? [Pull a Theranos](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/technology/elizabeth-holmes-testimony.html#:~:text=She%20also%20brushed,amounts%20of%20blood.), and send every ChatGPT prompt to someone else’s Siemens machine rather than their own proprietary one.

Sell for 400 million dollars in equity to some [hyped-up AI company](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/perplexity-has-reportedly-closed-a-500m-funding-round)? A tremendous win; this is why we build.

[^3]: The primary element on the [QuickSight landing page](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight) is not only a YouTube video from early 2019; it’s a YouTube video that’s primarily stock video of “happy professionals in chic office collaborating on computers,” with [sloppy screenshots](https://youtu.be/2V1bHRLRG-w?si=fwpyyAy2MF6Wv-BF&t=74) of “SpaceNeedle-Alpha”—the codename for QuickSight, I guess—badly superimposed over a people’s monitors.

[^4]: In a filing in Oregon, [AWS said that](https://www.co.morrow.or.us/sites/default/files/fileattachments/board_of_commissioners/meeting/packets/16379/4-27-22_agenda_packet_-_crez_iii_board_meeting.pdf) the buildings cost about $300 million, and the equipment in the buildings—a bunch of computers, presumably—costs $1.95 billion.

[^5]: According to Sam Altman, “as far as we know, no tech company has done before.” [According to Sam Altman’s ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/676474aa-964c-8010-8798-b97015c3b69c), tech companies have definitely done this before. Which I know is true, because Mode [did this before](https://x.com/ModeAnalytics/status/805124489755365376). Though technically, Sam Altman is right; we didn’t release one feature for 12 straight weekdays; we released one feature for twelve straight *calendar* days. (More like 12 straight weakdays, amirite?) (But in fairness to OpenAI, they don’t have [Emily Ritter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emritter)—the sort of marketer who’s always a lap ahead of everyone else; who knew that your accidental BI tool was a BI tool years before you did; who you could t-bone with bad ideas that got proven wrong so quickly, and revealed her ideas to be right so quickly, that you were the one who got whiplash—running their launch.)

[^6]: The o-series models seem a bit hard to classify, because they aren’t completely new foundational models like the GPT-series models are. They also include internal “reasoning” strategies that, very roughly, let the foundational model iterate its way through a problem. Is that a new model? To a user, who doesn’t really care how it works, probably. To an AI researcher who’s trying to find the limits of LLM pre-training? Probably…not really?

[^7]: Though that SaaS app is also becoming commoditized? OpenAI’s Projects feature is more or less a clone of Anthropic’s [Projects feature](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9517075-what-are-projects), and Grammarly, which is ChatGPT wrapper-ish, [just bought Coda](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/grammarly-acquires-productivity-startup-coda-brings-on-new-ceo/), which is Notion-ish.

[^8]: Importantly, note that this isn’t saying new models won’t get better. It’s saying that new models aren’t a durable advantage. Even if something like today’s o3 release is a big step forward, others companies will surely have roughly equivalent versions of the same thing soon.

Happy holidays, and thanks to everyone for reading along.

# VC Fantasy League

When I first started this blog, [this is what I said it’d be](https://benn.substack.com/p/a-brief-programming-note):

> Expect predictions about data technologies and observations about corporate data culture alongside the regularly scheduled commentary on Pitbull. (Or, if you’re here for the tech stuff, consider this a warning that you’ll have to put up with posts on Pitbull. Either way, there will be Pitbull content.)

Neither turned out to be true. The Pitbull thing is my *[Winds of Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter)*, and all of the promised posts about data technologies devolved into rants about how data is a [Ponzi scheme](https://benn.substack.com/p/disband-the-analytics-team), a [fad](https://benn.substack.com/p/is-being-data-driven-a-fad), an [industrial complex](https://benn.substack.com/p/insight-industrial-complex), and not [a career](https://benn.substack.com/p/is-this-a-career). 

Evidently, however, this is not a popular opinion. A while back, I [asked people](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-data-driven-companies-win#:~:text=Who%20do%20you%20invest%20in%3F%20Join%20the%20fantasy%20league!) to choose which of these five companies they’d invest in:

Over at [benn.ventures](https://benn.ventures/), our ranking would’ve been talent, experience, speed, operations, and, in dead last, data. But here at [benn.substack](https://benn.substack.com/), 180 readers’ rankings were very different:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!32Js!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8dfa8b-3db7-4e8b-a16a-ccae8c4869d5_1226x382.png)

The experienced company has the best average ranking, and the data-driven company has the highest net favorability score (i.e., first plus second choices minus fourth plus fifth choices). People have very mixed opinions on talent, they don’t love speed, and operators are the clear losers.

A rough tie at the top, then. But [ties are unsatisfying](https://benn.substack.com/p/moneyballing-the-world-cup?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=that%20real%20sports%20don%E2%80%99t%20routinely%20end%20in%20ties). So, how do people rank the two top attributes—experience and data—directly against one another? Sure, 30 percent of the respondents said that the experienced company was their first choice compared to 20 percent for data-driven company, but what percent of people would rather invest in the data company over the experienced one, regardless of how they score the other three companies?

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!m_30!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a9944bd-4cb7-498c-8cc5-6bd5e0aa0449_1302x308.png)

The data company wins every head-to-head matchup. If only two companies walked into the door of our collective VC office—instead of five at once, which is how the original question was framed—the data company would walk out with the term sheet every time.

Which, great, you can have it. Better terms for benn.ventures’ contrarian bets on talent.[^2]

# Contrarians

Speaking of, a few weeks ago, the internet revolted against Spotify Wrapped, for two reasons:

Because the only thing we want to know more than what we listen is that what we listen is was *cool*. We want to be different. We want to know that, while everyone else is [listening to Drake](https://www.tiktok.com/@trevorwallace/video/7444637662503324958), we are tastemakers; original thinkers; contrarians, with an exquisite palate.

Anyway, a year and a half ago, I [asked the readers of this blog](https://benn.substack.com/p/bi-by-another-name#footnote-4-119475953) to prove your contrarian bona fides. Pick a number between 1 and 20, I asked, with the goal of choosing a number that would be chosen by the fewest other people. Nobody wants to be the same as everyone else; prove that you aren’t.

Here are the results. It’s time for some game theory:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1xF9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F831cf023-ba91-4d61-bbf1-6bcb66bbffc2_1484x762.png)

Sixty-three people voted legally; three people cheated;[^4] zero people won. Because, oops, it turns out the contest was unwinnable: The winning numbers—6, 8, and 15—got no votes; had anyone voted for one of them, they would’ve no longer been winning numbers.

Still, three numbers were only chosen by one person each, which is pretty close to winning. So congratulations to the three readers who chose 9, 11, and 16—you are this blog’s best game theorist and its most promising influencers.

Of course, influencers need the influenced—the masses, the mainstream, the lemmings who march to [whatever generic beat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTpbbQUBbuo) Spotify’s algorithmic drum beats out. That’s you, whoever chose 1, 10, and 17. I am sorry, but your number wasn’t a banger of a B-side from the back of a Shoreditch record store. It was Drake. Oh well.

But that wasn’t the only question the survey asked. It also asked everyone to guess which number they thought would be chosen the *most*. Because being a contrarian only gets you so far. To be a true trailblazer, you also have to have taste, and [know what other people like](https://www.tiktok.com/@60minutes/video/7189964392400833834).

And people are surprisingly good at that? People predicted that 1, 7, and 17 would be the most popular answers to the first question; 1 and 17 were, in fact, the two most popular answers.[^5] In total, the average answer to the second question was the seventh most popular guess to the first question.[^6] Though people really overestimated the popularity of 7:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XyYN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46af2b47-71b0-4367-80c4-35d55127ba29_1484x762.png)

This second question also offers a way to break the tie among the three best answers to the first question. Who didn’t just pick an unpopular number, but also predicted what everyone else would choose? We have a winner:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iykc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2932274-a21a-4260-92dc-db98e710e18f_984x188.png)

Congratulations to Voter #11—coincidentally, they were both the eleventh response and the only person who voted for 11—who left this comment with their response:

> this actually hurt my brain, I'm embarrassed to admit how much time I spent on this meaningless activity.

Meaningless then, perhaps, but historic now. You are our champion. Our Rick Rubin. Our Kim Kardashian. You know us better than we know ourselves. Expect an email, Voter #11, and a major award.

And to the rest of you, keep pumping those Sabrina Carpenter streams. [Somebody gotta do it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8F5G5wR1mk&t=55s)

# Robots

To me, an almost geriatric millennial, R2-D2 is a robot. C-3PO is a robot. Wall-E is a robot. Alexa, Siri, and ChatGPT are not. They are disembodied search engines, a spell checker attached to a phone speaker. An immobile piece of glass is not a robot; robots are full of grease and gaskets and little blinking eyes that tell you they are on.[^7]

But what is a robot to a different generation? To a Boomer, is it a toaster oven with a timer? To Gen Z, is it the entire opaque machinery of Doordash? Does Gen Alpha even use the word at all, or has it been replaced by some [incomprehensible TikTok slang](https://x.com/brettdash_/status/1872036727235522796)? [I had to find out](https://benn.substack.com/p/all-your-database-are-belong-to-us?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=Share-,Name%20a%20robot.%C2%A0,-Seriously%2C%20take%20a).

Lots of you think R2-D2 is a robot; fewer of you think of C-3PO. The youths think of the Terminator, which is a little weird; the boomers think of Robby the Robot, which makes sense.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!F0XF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8373096a-44f6-4046-96c5-8f796652b093_1032x556.png)

But the strangest answer is HAL. The movie character HAL was created over 50 years ago.[^8] The *fictional* HAL—the thing created in 2001, when HAL went on its space odyssey—is 23 years old. That’s older than “[Hot in Herre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeZZr_p6vB8),” and “[Complicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NPBIwQyPWE),” and “[The Middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKsxPW6i3pM)”!* *That’s old![^9] Why is that the third-most popular robot for *20-year olds*?

Gen Z, man.

# Microsoft Excel

I have no idea what it says [that people think](https://benn.substack.com/p/is-excel-immortal#:~:text=Microsoft%20Excel-,What%20do%20you%20choose%3F,-2) that:

but that is evidently what people think.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wqck!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac45a4a2-b9c0-4268-b9da-655a1d98740b_1384x704.png)

Of course, another thing that people think—from the same survey; I don’t know; it made sense at the time—is that “A Whole New World” is the best song from *Aladdin*, and that “One Jump Ahead” is the worst. So sometimes people get things wrong.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2hLZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F014a2eac-12d0-435e-b99d-edf6f608e867_1284x778.png)

# Mailbag

Some people included questions in their survey responses. Other people left them on the most recent addition to the benn dot empire,[^10] [benn.gripe](http://benn.gripe/). These are some of those questions.

———

**Aren’t analytics engineers just…data engineers that don’t really use Python (and use dbt instead)? Why all the rigamarole?**

Many people [are saying](https://materializedview.io/p/merge-analytics-and-data-engineers):

> I’ve [long held](https://bsky.app/profile/archive.chris.blue/post/3l7htj4huw42b) that creating the “analytics engineer” role was a mistake. [dbt Labs says](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering), “Analytics engineers provide clean data sets to end users, modeling data in a way that empowers end users to answer their own questions.” I don’t believe that this set of activities is enough value to justify a full headcount; it’s too limited in scope and too far removed from revenue generation.

I don’t know; cleaning data and making it useful is [famously hard work](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html). If we assume that that cleaned data is valuable, then it certainly seems like dedicating a role to that task is worth the cost. This is especially true given how analysts often work: They are constantly building in pseudo-production, creating new appendages on top of core data systems that are designed to answer some unspecified set of questions for some unspecified amount of time. It gets unwieldy in a hurry, and it’s useful for somebody to be responsible for keeping the underlying architecture sane. Someone needs to [define and maintain production](https://benn.substack.com/p/what-is-production), and the analysts who are frantically updating a slide in the middle of a board meeting aren’t going to do it.

People may say, sure, but that’s the job of a data engineer. And maybe it should be. But here’s the problem:

In other words, the nature of data engineering has changed (or expanded), in a way that’s generally unfavorable to data engineers. In that context, I think analytics engineering is useful, not because it represents a distinct responsibility from data engineering, but because it’s a way to describe the methods through which the data engineers are expected to do it.

**Product management is overrated.**

*…and…*

**Do data teams feel like they are more part of product or finance?**

Matt Levine has this bit: [Everything is seating charts.](https://x.com/matt_levine/status/741025828960669696) Above all else, the richest people on Wall Street—the masters of the universe, people who can buy 122 million dollar mansions after [thinking about it for 15 minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Shleifer#Personal_life)—care about which clubs they’re in, and how important they are relative to everyone else in the club. A better seat, a better seat, my literal, actual kingdom, for a better seat.

Anyway, tech employees aren’t all that different. Data teams ostensibly want to be in the rooms where decisions are made to influence those decisions, but the real motivation is probably more direct: Being in the room is the whole point. It is its own ends. A few people want to be important to mold the world into some favored shape; most people just want to be important.

Culturally, data teams are probably more aligned with finance teams than product teams. Both are reactive bean counters who want to be more proactive “strategists;” both quietly relish saying no, telling people to be realistic, and policing other people’s logical reasoning; both count stuff.

But in Silicon Valley, “the builders” are important. Product teams and product leaders make the fun decisions, and get celebrated as visionaries. “Who is the best series C CFO right now?” is, at best, niche engagement bait on Twitter. So data teams [reject their natural allies](https://benn.substack.com/i/137070616/die-a-hero-or-live-long-enough-to-become-an-accountant), and try to sit at the product table.

**I don't like C-3PO.**

See, this is why I think R2-D2 was more popular. He’s a lovable sidekick, and C-3PO is more of an annoying tagalong, in the way as often as he is useful. I do sometimes wonder though—why is Jar Jar Binks seen as a historic cinematic mistake, but nobody is particularly bothered by C-3PO? (Case in point: “I don't like C-3PO” is a mildly hot take.) They’re functionally the same character: Both are bumbling klutzes who occasionally stumble into being a hero. Both are more slapstick stooge than warring spaceman. Both are clumsily rendered—Jar Jar Binks in bad CGI; C-3PO as a man in a stiff metal suit, a mannequin in shining gold armor, the little brother from *A Christmas Story* who [can’t put his arms down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKxsOlzuH0k). And yet, one is on lists of the [greatest movie characters of all time](https://www.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/best-movie-characters-of-all-time), and one is on [lists of the worst](https://www.imdb.com/poll/jJ8PxsNwlcE/results).

I’m not convinced that had Jar Jar Binks been in *A New Hope,* and a new doofus of a droid been in *A Phantom Menace, *our opinions of them would also be reversed. In the 1970s, hammy comedy seemed to play. Steve Martin sold out arenas with an act full of goofy props and silly catchphrases. Today, that kind of bit feels juvenile. But by the time we soured on it, C-3PO was already written into the hall of fame.

**Do you have any Darvin Ham opinions?**

Ron Gant hit titanic foul balls. Shaq was [lights out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQNe2q7VQLk&t=150s) from the free throw line in practice. Darvin Ham is [14-0 in NBA Cup games](https://sports.yahoo.com/nba-fans-react-bucks-darvin-061808471.html). Sometimes, the problem isn’t the player; the problem is the yardstick.

**Why is your LinkedIn account one week late on your essays?**

The professional writer finishes their pieces the day before they are due. They work with an editor to refine them, polishing, fact-checking, pruning. They publish on time, and then diligently share their work across different social media channels, posting catchy threads on Twitter that are engineered to spark conversation and engagement. They post on LinkedIn, TikTok, Bluesky, Instagram. They know that distribution matters as much as production, and they put in the work to do both.

The coffee shop Substacker crash lands unedited blog posts at random on Friday afternoons. By the time the piece is done—which has more to do with running out of time than with arriving at any sort of coherent rhetorical destination—he’s sick of reading it, so he immediately closes his laptop and wanders off aimlessly down the street. Eventually, he remembers to tweet something, though [it’s often a messy non sequitur](https://x.com/bennstancil) that he justifies by saying that that’s the whole bit, even though the bit is a tired [snowclone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowclone) that probably should’ve been retired years ago.

Eventually, he realizes that the piece isn’t doing numbers, and that his fragile ego needs more likes. But it’s 5pm, and his fragile ego also can’t handle being the guy who’s posting on LinkedIn on Friday night. So, he waits until Monday. And by then, someone has usually blown a hole in the original article, so the LinkedIn post can’t just be [an AI-generated twist](https://every.to/p/introducing-spiral) of the blog post; it has to be some back-heeled misdirection that the piece isn’t about what it was about.

———

**You should join Bluesky! Then you can have fun nerdy convos....not on LinkedIn. It's like Twitter from a decade ago, only better, I promise.**

*…and…*

**Can you email me a secret search term that I can use to find your shit-post alter-ego on Bluesky?**

My fragile-ego Bluesky: [benn.blue](http://benn.blue/).[^11]

My alter-ego Bluesky: It’s [too](https://x.com/301mair/status/1803617254552056241) many [options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains).

**I'd like to address that universal semantic layer...**

**I'd propose that in addition to the semantic layer sitting on top of the shared source of truth that has been ETL'd from all of the raw data through all the technical operations and, more importantly, all of the business rules—it needs to be augmented. We need the most brilliant analysts, to also have access to every field in every table of raw data (and we need to keep that data outside of the OLTP apps it came from), together with a complete definition of every column and every table, with any tool that is SQL compatible. To have the freedom, you can't have the governance, the shared, the single version of truth, the thousands of business rules, the limiting tool on top of them—you must also have access to fully defined raw data.**

What is raw data? I suppose you could have two answers:

I don’t think the second answer makes sense. But if the first answer is correct—that raw data is the most granular data that’s available—then what happens if you simply redefine “available” as what’s been processed by a semantic layer?

For example, suppose you collect by-the-millisecond pitch data, and transform that into pitch-by-pitch data. Do people have access to raw data? No, probably not. Do people *need* access to raw data? Well! Did they *need* spin rates in 1980?

My sense is that analysts are to raw data as everyone else is to self-serve. We want it more than we’d actually use it. Unlimited freedom *sounds* great, until we’re presented with a blank page and told to write. We need the prompts and constraints. Boundaries may limit us, but [the infinite paralyzes us](https://benn.substack.com/p/all-at-one-time?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20conferences%20are%20for%3A%20For%20showing%20us%20how%20wide%2Dranging%20a%20profession%20can%20be%2C%20while%20reminding%20us%20it%20is%20not%20infinite.%20If%20necessity%20is%20the%20mother%20of%20invention%2C%20boundaries%20are%20the%20mother%20of%20intention.)—and we are often better off accepting and [making the most of what we have](https://benn.substack.com/p/its-too-many-options) than we are spending our time trying to get more of what we don’t have.

We may hate the guardrails, but we need them. We need to live in a world that has those walls. We weep about them, but we have that luxury. We don’t actually want raw data because deep down in places we don't talk about, we want those walls, we need those walls. And those walls have neither the time nor the inclination to explain themselves to people who rise and sleep under the blanket of safety that they provide, and then question the manner in which they provide it.

(Which is all to say, sure, I think semantic layers shouldn’t be so restrictive that they roll everything up into a bunch of daily aggregates or something. But I don’t think people need whatever event stream the machines spit out either. There is some level of granularity that balances this correctly, and it could sit on either side of a semantic layer.)

**The thing is even if the genie [from Aladdin] owes you a lifetime of favors [after you wish them free], you have no guarantee on what personality traits the genie may have. Even if a promise of a "lifetime of favors" is offered, there's always the case where the genie ditches you after they’re free.**

*…and…*

**There is a difference between the product and the brand name—one can persist while the other changes. The fact you can get more wishes from freeing the genie is the point—you gain more by not enslaving him.**

Every [remake](https://aladdinthemusical.com/) of [Aladdin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRwBVYjUBOc) tells the story in more or less the same way: Aladdin falls in love; he befriends a genie; the two defeat Jafar; Aladdin gets the girl; he frees his friend. But now I want a new version, told as a game of cat and mouse between Aladdin and the genie. The genie is trying to ingratiate himself with Aladdin so that he sets him free; Aladdin is trying to figure out if giving the genie his freedom will win him a lifelong magical friend, or if he’s just getting played.

The real housewives of Agrabah; somebody gotta do that one too.

———

**Freeing the genie actually reduces their power. The lamp is a coercive force that takes something from the user and then refines and condenses the imprisoned djinn's magical energies (which is why you only get three shots). Freed from the lamp, the djinns return to being just playful spirits.**

This, plus Jafar’s plotline, seems like it creates another possible scheme to get essentially get more wishes. Jafar asked the genie to make him the most powerful sorcerer in the world. His power is second only to the power of the genie—who derives that extra power from bondage of the lamp. So, it seems like you can do this whole thing in two wishes:

Like, when Aladdin negged Jafar by saying “ah ha, but the genie is still more powerful than you,” what if Jafar had then said, “good point, I’ll set the genie free”? Would the two have been locked in some eternal cosmic struggle? Is a reduced genie still more powerful than a sorcerer? Would the Jafar become the de facto genie of the world, without the shackles? What would’ve happened *then*?

It might be time for me to find a job, y’all.
