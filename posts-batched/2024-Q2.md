In hindsight, maybe I shouldn’t have said that my career [was a Ponzi scheme](https://benn.substack.com/p/disband-the-analytics-team).

First, [oops](https://twitter.com/rogerskaer/status/1576025818182332416). Second, for the sake of my career prospects after I return from [spending more time with my family](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/23/business/23family.html),[^1] a counterpoint: Analytics is *not* a Ponzi scheme! [That post was some moron trying to go after us with false rumors.](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/klvyzjklmpg/SBF%20deleted%20tweets.pdf) Analytics is fine. We have a long history of creating shareholder value, and that remains true today. And I’d love it, fellow optimists, if we could work together for the ecosystem.

Details, of my new idea:

—

In his [frequently-bought](https://www.hawes.com/2011/2011-12-25.pdf) but [rarely-read](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-summers-most-unread-book-is-1404417569) opus *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, [Daniel Kahneman](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/business/daniel-kahneman-dead.html) famously argues that everyone has [two systems for thinking](https://fs.blog/daniel-kahneman-the-two-systems/):

System 1 is reactive, and makes decisions instinctively. While this system can be trained—it includes “learned skills such as [reading and understanding nuances of social situations](https://fs.blog/daniel-kahneman-the-two-systems/#:~:text=reading%20and%20understanding%20nuances%20of%20social%20situations),” which are hard when we’re young but eventually become reflexive—it isn’t driven by the careful study of a particular situation. Instead, it responds automatically, using assumptions that we develop about how the world works.

When we think about thinking, Kahneman says, “we identify with System 2, the conscious reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do.” Though we might assume that this second system—our brain’s logical processor—constructs the mental models that System 1 uses, the opposite is true: Much of System 2 is built by System 1. The impressions and feelings that originate from System 1 “are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2.” According to Kahneman, in the study of how we make decisions, we often focus on the analytical brain—but the real action is in the autonomous brain.[^2] 

Organizations, I’d say, think in an analogous way.[^3] Some decisions are made relatively slowly, with intention, and based on reasoned analysis. But most decisions are made quickly and instinctively, based on heuristics, experience, and some rough estimation of how the company works. For example, a business that struggles to bring in new customers with Facebook ads will eventually decide that online advertising doesn’t work for their market—and that will become an unspoken operational assumption that everyone “just knows.” If a CEO [talks loudly about their product’s usability issues](https://techcrunch.com/2008/06/25/gates-sends-angry-e-mail-sounds-just-like-a-customer/), people will begin to assume that product quality is one of their organizational weaknesses. If an executive spends too much time on Hacker News, they’ll make decisions based on the principle that they [should do things that don’t scale](https://paulgraham.com/ds.html), or that [a company’s market matters more than their product](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html), or that the [best leadership teams are the ones that fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njYciFC7mR8).[^4] 

When we talk about helping a company make better decisions—and particularly when data teams talk about it—we’re naturally drawn to improving how well System 2 works, and how it can counteract the impulsive nature of System 1. We need to rely less on intuition and more on insight, we say; we need [everyone to be more comfortable](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/data-expertise-everywhere) reasoning about data. We need to invite more analysts [into the rooms in which decisions get made](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-missing-analytics-executive). In many ways, this is how analysts define our jobs—to *be* System 2.

But I think that’s misguided, and why a lot of analysts are [often frustrated](https://petrjanda.substack.com/p/elevate-the-role-of-analytics-in) by their position on the [corporate seating chart](https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/741025828960669696?lang=en). One of the key arguments in *Thinking, Fast and Slow *is that we can neither outrun or out-reason System 1’s unconscious engine. The same is true for how companies think: They have to make too many decisions to analyze all of them. No matter how fast we are or how good our tools get, most decisions will be made using System 1; we can’t whack-a-mole them away, by putting an analyst in every room or a BI tool on every laptop. 

Nor can ever fully override System 1. Once executives have theories about how the world works, developed by their professional experience and confirmed their professional success, a bean counter with a disagreeable spreadsheet is unlikely to change their mind.[^5] If we are the company’s second system, we’ll always be second chair.

Still, this framework suggests that there’s a [third option for data teams](https://benn.substack.com/p/disband-the-analytics-team#:~:text=Disband%20or%20rebrand%E2%80%94that%20may%20be%20our%20choice.): Stop trying to work against System 1 thinking, and start working with it.

# Drill, ream, countersink, spot face, hone and bore

I have no idea what’s been going on at Boeing over the last twenty years, but it sounds like the story went something like this:

A while ago, some Boeing executives developed a belief that Boeing planes were good, that their manufacturing standards were reliable, and that a variety of their quality assurance programs were more expensive than they needed to be. I imagine they asked some analysts to run the numbers: “If we cut some corners, will the doors start blowing off of our airplanes?”

“It depends,” the analysts probably responded. Today, we employ 300 door latch mechanics, and the probability of a door blowing off of an airplane this year is 0.456 percent. If we fire half of our mechanics, the probability of a door blowing off goes up to 1.661 percent. Here are various precise figures and statistics that say [this might be dangerous](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-03-29/boeing-heard-the-warnings-it-just-didn-t-listen).

“Eh,” the executives must’ve said, “1.661 percent still sounds very low. It sounds like our general theory is right; we can still make good planes with good door latches even if we cut our safety program’s budget. Plus, if we fire half of our mechanics, the probability of us saving 20 million dollars is 100 percent, which is a lot higher than 1.661 percent. [George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_in_the_Air_(2009_film)), fire the mechanics.” 

And then Boeing fired the mechanics, and then the doors started [blowing off](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/05/business/alaska-airlines-flight-portland-landing.html) of Boeing airplanes, and then Boeing [was worth 40 billion dollars less](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-11/boeing-shares-extend-2024-drop-past-25-on-us-investigation?embedded-checkout=true) than it was before the doors blew off its airplanes. 

So the analysts crunched more numbers. If another door blows off of another airplane, they estimated, the FAA will require us to ground 12 percent of our fleet. Revenue will decline by between 15 and 18 percent over the next two quarters. Our stock will lose another 40 to 50 billion dollars. We will all get fired. A report was produced that contained many alarming charts. 

We should rehire some of those mechanics, the ([new](https://investors.boeing.com/investors/news/press-release-details/2024/Boeing-Announces-Board-and-Management-Changes/default.aspx)) executives concluded. [Job listings were posted.](https://jobs.boeing.com/job/berkeley/assembly-mechanic-quality-inspector/185/61943182304)[^6] They did not specifically mention doors, but they’re probably about the doors.

One way to look at this story[^7] is that executives made several data-driven decisions, based on the careful research of their analytics team. But that’s almost certainly not what really happened? Though System 2 was present, it was overwhelmed by the executives’ System 1 assumptions for how Boeing works—first, that Boeing had highly reliable but overly expensive quality assurance programs, and then, all of the sudden, that product quality is an existential problem and that [Boeing should put](https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2024-03-25-Boeing-Announces-Board-and-Management-Changes#:~:text=safety%20and%20quality%20at%20the%20forefront%20of%20everything%20that%20we%20do) “safety and quality at the forefront of everything that we do.” 

Obviously, Boeing’ executives didn’t change their mind because of some analyst’s report; they changed their mind because the doors started blowing off of their airplanes. Years ago, analytical warnings from engineers didn’t change any executives’ minds about the need to invest in quality and safety; now, I suspect, no amount of analysis could change their minds that anything matters more than quality and safety. And that’s the point—when companies make decisions, analysis will almost always be the [lower order bit](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-modern-data-stack-was-never-big-enough#footnote-7-139619217). The mental model dominates. 

# Theory over action

So does this mean analysts are useless? No—it just means that we’ve probably been doing the wrong thing.

Today, if you ask an analyst what their job is, the Very Smart answer is that they help people make better decisions by providing them with [actionable](https://benn.substack.com/p/disband-the-analytics-team#:~:text=various%20other%20nouns%20are%20actioned) insight. We’re at our best, we say, when we can study a strategic problem and make concrete recommendations about how to address it.

But these sorts of recommendations are individual fish. Best case, they’ll feed a company for a day.[^8] The much more powerful thing that we could do is teach a company a theory—or as Ahbi put it, our job shouldn’t be to look for insights, but to mutate mental models. 

In other words, we shouldn’t work against an organization’s System 1 thinking; we should work *through* it. Don’t veto biased thinking; update the bias. Don’t protect companies from making decisions with rough heuristics; make sure the heuristics are still current. 

Which, easier said than done—it took the several massive tragedies for Boeing’s executives to update theirs. Still, for those of us who work on more trivial problems than keeping planes in the air, I think there are a couple relatively simple things we could all do to nudge ourselves in that direction.

First, we should try to explicitly identify the assumptions that people have about how stuff works. [Bobby Pinero describes a potential approach:](https://wrap-text.equals.com/p/the-curious-analyst)

> I would keep a list of every comment I overheard in any discussion that sounded like an opinion, a thought, or a disagreement that I thought might possibly be proved, debunked, or clarified with some form of analysis. I would source these comments in meetings, water-cooler chats, over lunch, happy hour, or any other forum of discussion. Tune your ear, and you’d be quite surprised at the number of conversations with no resolution, or worse yet, that decisions are made from unfounded, unproven opinions.

These unproven opinions are the edges of an organization’s System 1 brain. Just as Kahneman’s exploration of our cognitive biases was the first step in learning how to work with them, Bobby’s observational search for hidden mental models is our first step in figuring out how to mutate them.

Second, we probably *shouldn’t* focus on delivering “actionable insight;” we should deliver theories. If we conclude some analysis with a recommendation to take this particular action in this particular scenario, it’s easy to view that result in isolation. It might violate some System 1 framework but it doesn’t *challenge* it. It can be comfortably dismissed as an exception. 

Theories, by contrast, ask people to see the world differently. There’s something [inherently seductive about theories](https://www.vox.com/culture/24062406/tiktok-trends-slang-terms-coining), from [orange peel theory](https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/1/25/24048474/orange-peel-theory-tiktok-relationship-test-explained) to [loud budgeting](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-loud-budgeting-trend-can-it-work/) to theories about the relationship between Boeing’s quality assurance engineers and their airplane’s doors. They compel us to stop and reflect, in ways that facts and insights don’t. And if we change them, the effects echo, not through one decision, but [through thousands](https://benn.substack.com/p/small-multiplies).

Or that’s my theory, at least until I can get another Ponzi scheme up and running.

[^1]: I mean, no, good grief, this is a joke. I wasn’t fired because of that post. [I left to pursue other interests.](https://www.cfo.com/news/to-pursue-other-interests/681996/)

[^2]: These quotes are from page 21 of *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, because I bought it for my [Zoom background](https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/article/best-books-zoom-call-background-bookcase-smart-shelf/) and obviously haven’t read anything past chapter 2.

[^3]: Well, I wouldn’t say this. [Abhi Sivasailam](https://twitter.com/_abhisivasailam?lang=en) said this, to me, at a conference last week. It was a very good analogy, and [I like analogies](https://benn.substack.com/p/in-defense-of-analogies), so I stole it.

[^4]: If there’s an [earthquake in New York](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/at00sbh3yv/executive) on the same day that [Olivia Rodrigo plays at Madison Square Garden](https://twitter.com/TheGarden/status/1776278594550923372) *and* [Griff drops a new EP](https://www.instagram.com/p/C5YJefDo1Ob/?img_index=1), I will assume that it’s a sign from the cosmos and will spend the rest of my life trying to figure out What It All Means.

[^5]: As analysts, we often get upset about this, but we do the same thing. Imagine, for example, that a high school student is asking you for career advice. Think about the various fortune cookie aphorisms you might tell them, like “find a great manager, because people don’t quit their jobs, they quit their bosses.” Now imagine that I show up with some detailed analysis that says, well actually, [that’s not quite right](https://hbr.org/2018/01/why-people-really-quit-their-jobs). Would you immediately change your mind? The next time you were looking for a job, would you pay less attention to who your potential manager would be because my charts said it doesn’t matter as much as you think? Or would you discount my analysis, or try to contort it to fit into your existing worldview? Of course you would—and probably *should*—do the latter! Once we develop these sorts of general theories about how the world works, it’s really hard to reject them.

[^6]: This job posting is wild. The job duties are basically to build an entire airplane? You will be asked to “assemble aircraft and/or spacecraft structures or aircraft and/or spacecraft support equipment structures.” You will also need to “install press fit bushings and force fit bushings. File, fit, hone, ream, drill, tap, saw, burr and adjust.” [Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plXIfAQ_JWw&t=27s)

[^7]: In which all the specifics are quite obviously made up.

[^8]: Worst (and more likely) case is that they’re deemed “interesting” and dismissed, much like the warnings were at Boeing.

# PlayerCoach.ai investor update – Q1 2024

*Please keep this confidential. *

---

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/27ed0057-584b-4355-99e7-d7c55d47fbc4_1600x812.png)

Players, coaches, and team,

It’s been a very productive quarter. Though growth was slower than we hoped, we’ve made several important adjustments to our business that we believe will position us for a strong rebound in the second half of the year. We started to execute on our new plans last month, and we’ve already had more promising conversations (three) with prospects and partners than I can count. Our new small-but-mighty team is energized to keep building, and to fulfill our mission of **helping every player be a player for life. **

## What is PlayerCoach? + strategy update

When we founded PlayerCoach, our original vision was to build an AI coach that would turn 10x engineers into 10x managers. Though we quickly found strong product-market fit—over the last year, *dozens* of developers asked our AI experts *hundreds *of questions about how to be better managers—these users’ employers failed to want to buy. After talking with several customers and doing the [Five Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys) while on a truckload of ketamine (thank you to our friends at [Founders Fund](https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-microdosing-ketamine-lsd-magic-mushrooms-d381e214) for the intro to [ATAI](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/peter-thiel-backs-psychedelics-startup-atai.html)!), we realized that we were underestimating the productive potential of AI, and that our vision wasn’t big enough. 

Starting last month, we refocused the company on a new ambition: Not to *train* human managers, but to *replace* them. Rockstar engineers don't want to be rockstar managers; they want to keep being rockstar engineers. But they get pulled into management, to help coach other employees. For engineering teams, it’s a catch-22: To scale your best talent, you have to sacrifice it. 

With PlayerCoach, companies will no longer have to make this choice. Customers can tell us who their best engineers are, and for each one, we train a custom AI agent on an extensive catalog of managerial training resources and on that engineer’s individual body of work.[^1] These bots can then operate as autonomous managers: They run one-on-ones, provide regular feedback, complete performance evaluations, and even conduct interviews and employee terminations. 

With this new direction, our goal is to make the [Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle) obsolete: High performers should get promoted to their level of expertise, and PlayerCoach will take care of the rest. 

We believe that this could be a category-defining business. Devin, a startup that aims to replace junior engineers, is [already worth $2 billion](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/a-peter-thiel-backed-ai-startup-cognition-labs-seeks-2-billion-valuation-998fa39d). We are aiming even higher, and want to replace [engineering managers](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Engineering-Manager-Salary), who make 80 percent more than [junior engineers](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Junior-Engineer-Salary-in-New-York-City,NY). Moreover, [ChatGPT believes](https://chat.openai.com/share/ba28f662-8eb0-4b70-a6dc-6bc9c6dc42e5) that our TAM is $800 trillion, growing at a CAGR of 200 percent. 

Our primary goal for 2024 is to execute on this new vision, hit our revenue targets, and put ourselves in a strong position to raise a funding round by the end of the year. 

## Key metrics

Up 1 percent this quarter (just under our target of 20 percent). We’re disappointed with this number, but I think it’s misleading for a few reasons: 

That said, because “Brave” and “Truth” are two of our core values, we want to be honest about this quarter’s forecasts. Based on early conversations with our sales leaders, we think it would be best to bravely lower our growth target for Q2 from 22 percent to 5 percent.[^3] 

The good news is that we’re still confident that we can hit our annual goals. We know that the market will be excited about the new products we’re shipping, and we expect to make up for the slower-than-planned growth in Q1 and Q2 with faster growth in Q3 and Q4. Our finance team figured out a way to compound a bunch of individually-plausible-but-collectively-impossible assumptions into a financial model that says we’ll grow by 6 percent this quarter, 30 percent in Q3, and 140 percent in Q4. We’re confident in this plan.[^4] 

The marketing team had its best quarter ever, bringing in 45 new leads and almost $5 million in enterprise pipeline. These deals are still early, but we’ve had lots of very promising conversations and prospects are leaning in. For example, just yesterday, we talked to Capital One, and they said they were “[not interested](https://twitter.com/Jason/status/1778068878846840839)”—so we now expect them to close as early as next month. 

While the cost of acquiring these leads was high, that’s because we’ve been experimenting with new marketing campaigns to support our new vision and our 2024 “[enterprise-ready](https://benn.substack.com/p/so-you-want-to-sell-to-the-enterprise)” objective. As we all know, this is a process that’ll take a few months, a few quarters, maybe, maybe, a year. We expect costs to come down considerably as we ship new features[^5] and refine our enterprise marketing campaign.[^6] 

We hit an all-time high in cumulative product signups this quarter. Active users are also up 35 percent from Q4. Some of you asked if this is because we recently adjusted our definition of “active” to include anyone who interacts with an email (clicks a link, opens the email, is sent an email, marks an email as spam, etc.). We haven’t had a chance to do the additional analysis necessary to answer this question, but I’ll have the team follow up soon.

## Product

No updates this quarter. Lots of good stuff coming soon though :-)

## Team

We unfortunately had to part ways with a handful of team members this quarter, and executed a 14 percent reduction in force.[^7] Though we have plenty of runway, we believe that this rightsizing will help us remain lean and focused. It also gives us more options as a business, because these cost savings [put us on a path to being profitable](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/the-best-slides-from-softbanks-wework-focused-earnings-report/#:~:text=What%E2%80%99s%20the%20result%3F%20The%20flip%20of%20our%20first%20chart%3A) in 18 to 24 months, if we choose to take it.  

We also had a team offsite last month. It was a very productive three days: We finalized the 2022 financial plan, wrote down this year’s OKRs on an Etch-a-Sketch, hosted a customer panel, and ate way too many tacos :-). The team also organized a resume writing workshop for themselves, which is the sort of proactivity that defines the PlayerCoach family.

## **Financial summary**

## **Asks**

To set ourselves up for our fundraise later this year, we’ll be sharing our new direction with outside investors soon. We’re targeting a handful of top-tier firms initially, and I’ll be in touch with each of you individually for introductions to partners. Don’t worry; we won’t be wasting time by having conversations with [proletarian associate plebes](https://twitter.com/darrenmarble/status/1777001620074795419/quotes). Here’s a quick blurb if you need one:

> PlayerCoach is the world’s first autonomous engineering manager. All too often, great engineers are asked to delve into management to “scale themselves” for the broader engineering organization. PlayerCoach builds custom AI agents that enables these engineers to be both managers and developers at the same time.[^9] PlayerCoach’s founding team has been delving into this problem for over six years, and already has more than 50 customers, including Autodesk.[^10] Delve into more details at PlayerCoach.ai.

We'd also love your help spreading the word about our vision, so please share on your socials! If you need ideas, these are a few of the new taglines that we’re using:

Finally, as always, we would always appreciate introductions to great talent. Though we’re continuing to hire across a number of roles, these are the key positions we’re focused on this quarter:

Looking forward to a great 2024,

Benn, CEO, PlayerCoach

If you spend enough time with early stage companies in Silicon Valley, you’ll notice that founders are often focused on making sure that their companies are [well-positioned to raise another funding round](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/lessons-from-going-freemium-a-decision#:~:text=It%20was%20quickly%20clear%20that%20we%20weren%E2%80%99t%20putting%20ourselves%20in%20the%20best%20position%20to%20raise%20a%20meaningful%20Series%20B.%C2%A0) from venture capitalists. “If we can get above a million in ARR this year,” we’d say, “we think that’ll be enough to close a great series A.” Or, “we need to double revenue this year without increasing our [burn multiple](https://sacks.substack.com/p/the-burn-multiple-51a7e43cb200), and that’ll put us in a position to raise a series B.”

On one hand, this makes some sense; in Silicon Valley, fundraising rounds are the elementary school grade levels for startups. The occasional high-achievers might skip one, but most of us have to pass through them sequentially. To graduate from high school, you’ve got to pass first grade, then second, up to twelfth grade; to achieve the breakout success that most startups are chasing, they have to raise a seed round, then an A, then a B, and so on. It makes sense to focus on what you need to do to pass the grade you’re in, and worry about the next one once you make it there.

On the other hand, this approach is a trap. Unlike elementary school students, companies don’t start with a new slate every year. Nothing resets after they raise a round. If a struggling student crams for weeks before their end-of-year exams and barely passes, they have all summer to rest before the next year starts. If a surviving-but-not-thriving startup limps past a million dollars in revenue and closes their series A, they have to immediately turn that same company into one making four to five million dollars in 24 months. Because, as I’ve said before, [there is no step two](https://benn.substack.com/i/140621963/carta-again). Whatever business gets a startup to their A needs to get them to their B. Money gives them resources, but it doesn’t give them a new market, a new product, or a new idea. A failing chatbot is still a failing chatbot, with or without the backing of some guy named [David or Scott](https://www.forbes.com/lists/midas/?sh=ea51fa65922e).

In other words, startups shouldn’t raise a round with the goal of spending that money to hit whatever targets will get them to the next round. They should raise money to test their idea. The goal of a seed round isn’t be to raise a series A; it’s to prove that the product and the company has a clear path to raising a series B, a series C, and beyond. If founder *can* close an A round, but [can’t escape the feeling](https://benn.substack.com/i/117915273/full-hearts) that something will have to change to close the eventual B, don’t do the A.

In her book *Quit*, [Annie Duke explains](https://www.amazon.com/Quit-Power-Knowing-When-Walk/dp/0593422996) why Stewart Butterfield shut down Glitch, the company he founded before starting Slack:

> They had just experienced their highest growth in new accounts, but he saw a future where they would have to sustain [that same rate of] week-over-week growth…for thirty-one weeks just to break even. And that was assuming the new users they acquired were going to convert to paying customers at the same historical rate, a pretty big assumption since it stood to reason that the more eyeballs they got, the lower the quality those eyeballs would be.

Butterfield built a business that was passing its current grade, and could’ve easily raised more money. But Glitch was unlikely to pass the grades that were coming next. In those moments, it’s deeply tempting to keep going—to send the rosy investor updates, to build the optimistic financial models, to assume the pivot will redefine the trajectory of the company, to think everything will be different after you close this round—but it’s often wrong. Don’t raise money because you won the last race; raise money because you’re confident you can win the next race.

[^1]: Well, right now, we prompt GPT-3.5 with a link to *[Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) *and the engineer’s most recent 20 Slack messages, but we’ll eventually build custom agents on top of a proprietary LLM.

[^2]: I mean, no, not exactly; we’re also offering free services to design partners in exchange for testimonials. But social proof and gated case studies that get downloaded three dozen times in six months will *turn into *money, right?

[^3]: We also need to lower it because Autodesk, our third biggest customer, is probably going to churn at the end of the month. But they were oversold by a cavalier sales rep, are also going through a reorg, and our champion hasn’t responded to any of our emails in six months. Again, an unlucky and unique exception.

# Do software companies actually have good margins?

*Survey says no.*

![Speculation on Redshift in a Created Universe | Answers Research Journal](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YH-R!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d94501f-ebb3-4b8b-ba31-3c05c36a0e82_2000x1414.jpeg)
*[Redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift)*

*The* theory of software businesses goes something like this:

In slightly more formal terms, the marginal cost of producing a new “unit” of software is zero. For example, last year, 320,000,000 people used Microsoft Teams every month. I was not one of them. If I had been, I would’ve added a bit more load to Microsoft’s servers, and their server costs would’ve gone up by a few cents. But their revenue would’ve gone up by [four dollars](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-business-options). That’s a pretty good deal, for Microsoft. 

For other businesses, the deal isn’t nearly as good. A coffee shop can’t sell an additional ten-dollar [frozen tahini cold brew slushy](https://www.tiktok.com/@meghasinghx/video/7353024168104922411)[^2] without spending a few more dollars on ingredients and a dollar or two more to pay the barista who makes it.[^3] [McKinsey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiOUojVd6xQ) can’t take on an additional million-dollar consulting client without paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to a couple of 27-year old UPenn graduates to [advise the client](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4sj3tGOoBt/?hl=en). But Microsoft can produce an additional unit of software that they can sell for four dollars by spending less than ten cents. 

In practice, the math isn’t quite that good. Though companies can “manufacture” software at effectively no cost, it does cost them money to *sell and support* it. Microsoft pays thousands of support agents to help customers use their products; they pay engineers to maintain their servers, and they sometimes have to [hire a guy with an angle grinder](https://twitter.com/cullend/status/1445156376934862848) to fix them. If you add up all of these costs, known as the “cost of goods served,” or COGS, it probably costs Microsoft about a dollar to support an additional four-dollar seat on Teams. That “gross margin” of 75 percent—three dollars of profit on four dollars of revenue—is still a pretty good deal, and still much higher than it is for most other industries. 

This dynamic also has an important implication: It compels software companies to get really big. If you spent three million dollars designing some product that you can now “manufacture” for one dollar and sell for four dollars, that’s great—but you’re three million dollars in the hole. You have to sell at least a million units just to cover your costs. 

But once you do that, why stop there? You know what’s cooler than a million units and three million dollars? [A ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e0n7vTLz1U)*[billion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e0n7vTLz1U)*[ units](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e0n7vTLz1U), and three *billion* dollars. If you’re going to build a magic machine that prints money, you might as well find as many customers as you can and print yourself into *Forbes*.

So, *the* theory of Silicon Valley—”software has great margins”—becomes *the* business plan for Silicon Valley:

It’s hard to overstate how important this theory—that software, once designed, can be manufactured for very little money and sold for lots of money—is for Silicon Valley. [According to Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2019/what-is-a-tech-company/), it’s the defining feature of tech companies, “which are characterized by a zero marginal cost component that allows for uncapped returns on investment.” This theory is why venture capitalists and private equity firms invest hundreds of billions of dollars in software businesses that have been [losing money for over a decade](https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-q2-earnings-report-2023-453c335a). It’s why engineers are paid such high salaries—because they can design something that can eventually be sold for almost pure profit. It’s why [the whole Silicon Valley scheme](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-whole-scheme) isn’t quite a Ponzi scheme: If you put enough money into a software company, it could, in theory, turn into a magic machine that transforms one dollar into four. 

But what if the theory is wrong? What if the most important cornerstone in Silicon Valley is actually a [teetering liability](https://xkcd.com/2347/)?

# For sale, as is

On one hand, the theory isn’t *entirely* wrong. If I were to buy [Final Cut Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933) from Apple, I’m quite confident that $299.99 will move from my bank account into theirs, and some code will move from their computers onto mine. This will cost me a lot of money, and it will cost them very little. So *something* works.

On the other hand, something else quite clearly *doesn’t* work. In addition to measuring gross margins, companies also measure *operating* margins. To return to the coffee shop example, suppose they sell 100,000 coffees a quarter, at an average of ten dollars a drink, for a total of one million dollars. If they spent 400,000 dollars on ingredients and on paying baristas to make coffees—money they have to spend to produce an order; their COGS—their gross margins are 60 percent. But that’s not the only money the coffee shop spends in the quarter. They also have to pay rent; they have to buy machines; they have to pay coffee scientists to test and develop their next signature drink, like a [Mexican Corn Latte](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw5Y2j9OICh/?hl=en). If they spend 550,000 dollars on these operating expenses, in addition to 400,000 dollars on making coffees, they would only make 50,000 dollars in actual profit on one million dollars in revenue. Their operating margin, then, would be 5 percent.[^4] 

Roughly, gross margins measure how much profit a business *could* make, given what it costs to manufacture what they sell. Operating margins measure how much profit they *actually* make. Intuitively, you’d expect companies with high gross margins to have higher operating margins. If you spend a lot manufacturing what you sell, there won’t be much left over for you to keep. But if your manufacturing costs are very low—or close to zero, as they are for software companies—you could, in theory, keep most of it. That’s *the* reason software companies are valuable: the “zero marginal cost component that allows for uncapped returns on investment.”

And yet! According to [Jamin Ball’s figures](https://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/clouded-judgement-41224-march-cpi#:~:text=A%20%25%20Revenue%3A%2016%25-,Comps%20Output,-Rule%20of%2040), the average public software-as-a-service company has gross margins of 74 percent—it only costs them a dollar to manufacture something they can sell for four dollars. This is almost double the gross margin of the average company in the S&P 500, which is [around 40 to 45 percent](https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry_Profitability_Ratios.php?sp5).[^5] However, the average *operating* margin for an S&P 500 company is positive 15 percent, compared *negative *11 percent for the average SaaS company. Despite their high gross margins, SaaS companies don’t just make less than other public companies; most of them actually *lose* money.

I mean, what? Where does all of it go?

One answer is that too many companies get stuck in step two, and never make it to “vast, incalculable profit.” [Jamin, again:](https://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/clouded-judgement-41224-march-cpi)

> Many software companies will get disrupted before they hit maturity mode (which means they never generate meaningful [free cash flow, which is similar to profit]!). … [T]hey get disrupted before they can become a platform with enduring moats.
> The other challenge is that rarely are companies, even the most mature software companies, truly operating in maturity mode. … Let’s look at Salesforce - they may be in maturity mode in their core CRM business, but they also have marketing, commerce and data cloud products that are not in maturity mode. So even the most mature software businesses are still operating, to some extent, in growth mode. 

Empirically, this seems true enough; of the 79 public software companies that Jamin tracks [in his weekly updates](https://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/clouded-judgement-41224-march-cpi), 55 of them are still operating at loss. Moreover, the median profit-making SaaS business makes 1.6 billion dollars of revenue a year, while the median profit-losing one makes 600 million dollars in revenue. That implies that companies don’t typically get to step three—the step in which they’re making a profit—until they’re bringing in about a billion dollars a year in revenue. Not only is that a threshold very few companies cross, but it also raises a pretty obvious question: Why? Why is it so hard for software companies with high gross margins *and*  high revenues  to turn a profit?

The uncomfortable answer, I think, is that software margins—and especially SaaS margins—are an accounting fiction.

Imagine, for example, that you’re out shopping for a new LLM to use to build [the world’s first autonomous engineering manager](https://benn.substack.com/p/playercoachai-investor-update-q1). You go to OpenAI; Sam Altman says that their models are going to [keep getting better](https://twitter.com/HarryStebbings/status/1779910562362654728), up to and beyond the point of us all being dead. You go to Facebook; [Justin Timberlake](https://images.app.goo.gl/gUkTJTuJuyauijf86) tells you that they’re [upgrading Meta AI](https://www.instagram.com/p/C56JwCSRMiS/?hl=en) with new state-of-the-art technology. 

And then you come to Benn.AI, the AI superstore. I tell you that we have the best AI in the world (we don’t, but imagine). I show you that it’s currently at the top of the [AI leaderboard](https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard) (it’s not, but imagine). But our AI is fixed, I say. We have no roadmap; we are comfortably parked at the end of a cul-de-sac. What you buy from the AI superstore is what you get from the AI superstore. No returns, no refunds, and most importantly, no upgrades. 

You definitely wouldn’t buy my model? And that’s not just because LLMs are advancing so quickly; it’s because when we buy software today, and especially enterprise software, *we expect it to improve*. The roadmap is part of the sales pitch. Customers complain, and sometimes churn, when vendors are slow to release new updates. They won’t subscribe to our coffee shop unless they like today’s drinks (a [Pandan Coconut Foam Latte](https://www.instagram.com/p/C5RKyWZLt6D/)) *and* next season’s drinks ([The Surreal Taro Latte, with sprinkles](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs9VjPMpL4r/)). In SaaS, you aren’t just selling what your software is; you’re selling what it will become—and you can’t sell something that’s stagnating. 

In other words, software development costs *are *COGS. Not literally; not according to the accountants. But in practice, if you can only sell SaaS software—and retain customers—by promising a steady stream of new releases, how are the expenses associated with developing those releases functionally any different than the money you spend on servers and support agents?

The [conventional view](https://leadedge.com/why-we-like-saas-businesses/) is that these development costs are voluntary “reinvestments” that companies make, to add more potential energy to step three magic money machine: 

> In the case of SaaS companies, earnings bases are typically negative, based not upon poor financial structures, but rather upon high rates of reinvestment made to support the accelerated growth of their valuable high-margin recurring revenue base. Given the highly recurring, low churn revenue base, it is fairly simple to calculate the net present value of the installed customer base assuming the company was operating under a steady-state condition (i.e., not investing for new growth). Over the long run, the revenue bases should evolve to support strong earnings bases due to significant operating leverage.

But can SaaS businesses ever operate “under a steady-state condition,” when they aren’t investing for growth? Would prospects, who’ve grown accustomed to promises of constant updates and innovation, buy that product? Will customers continue to be “highly recurring” and “low churn” if a company downshifts into maintenance mode? 

The entire SaaS model assumes that the answer to these questions could be yes. It assumes that software companies can reach some steady-state, in which they spend less, and their customers remain loyal. It assumes customers buy what’s on the shelf, and not what they think is coming next. 

Though that might’ve work for software delivered in box, I’m not so sure it works for subscription software. If a company is going to charge perpetual fees, customers are going to want perpetual updates. 

# A special snowflake, like everyone else

The good news, perhaps, is that acknowledging the problem may be most of what we need to do to solve it. By classifying the costs of designing software differently than the costs of manufacturing it, and by telling ourselves gentle lies about how we’ll one day reach an equilibrium in which those former costs are no longer necessary, we excuse that expense. Development costs are high because investing in growth, we say. We can afford to be inefficient, because we aren’t a low margin business. 

It’s probably time for software businesses, and SaaS businesses in particular, to drop that identity. We should build a new theory that acknowledges that software can’t be sold unless it’s continually being redesigned and updated, that software margins aren’t actually that high, and that step three is mostly a theoretical fantasy. We should kick out the outdated cornerstone, and build a new business plan with the pieces that are still useful. 

There are good businesses to be built on top of these pieces. Every other industry does it. But we won’t, not until we’re honest with ourselves about what the pieces really are.

[^2]: Yes, Megha, it tastes like sugary peanuts. That’s exactly the point.

[^3]: When businesses calculate how much it costs them to serve one more unit of a product, it’s typically averaged across all of their sales. If a coffee shop serves 100 orders a day, it’ll pay one barista about [140 dollars](https://www.indeed.com/career/barista/salaries/New-York--NY) to serve them. If I go to that coffee shop and spend ten dollars, the barista probably won’t make any of that money directly. But if the coffee shop starts serving 200 orders, they’ll have to hire another barista. So the marginal cost of serving those extra 100 orders is 140 dollars, or $1.40 per order.

[^4]: This ignores some details about things like taxes and interest, but close enough.

[^5]: Is this website reliable? I have no idea. The other figures in the table, like net margin, are roughly consistent with [more reputable sources](https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-profit-margins-are-finally-stabilizing-creating-new-tailwind-for-stocks-bbbdbcc4), so I’m going with it. But if anyone has access to a Bloomberg terminal, please tell me if I’m wrong. (Also, speaking of high margins, [Bloomberg terminals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bloomberg_terminal.asp).)

# BI’s third form

*Help us with the hard thing.*

![Which font do they use for these parking signs? And are there maybe  look-a-likes? : r/identifythisfont](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MZeW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb09856-c289-498c-b17a-e1e6b526a749_1080x1080.jpeg)
*We can read the signs, but we don’t know what they mean.*

Ten years ago, if you were a jaded forty-something-year-old tech executive, you bought a Porsche and a house in Jackson. You opened a bar in Oakland, or a coffee shop in Mill Valley. You learned a lot about woodworking, Patek Philippe, and divorces. You Benjamin Buttoned yourself—got [hair plugs](https://cosmedica.com/elon-musk-hair-transplant/), dressed down by [two generations](https://www.instagram.com/p/C56JwCSRMiS/?hl=en), and [met your new 28-year-old fiancée in the middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW7Nq2UBlbk).[^1] 

Today, there are new fads. Today, every jaded forty-something-year-old tech executive has one of three ambitions:

For most people, these are the inevitable attractions. However, if you’re a jaded forty-something-year-old tech executive *from a data company*, you might be tempted by a fourth option: Build a data product, for a specific vertical. 

For you, after having spent years making operational middleware for data teams, the grass (and money) in other departments is starting to look greener. “Analytics teams are cost centers,” you might say, “Their budgets get cut too quickly. We have to sell customers on our product *and *[on the value of their data teams](https://hex.tech/blog/data-team-roi/). Rather than making yet another BI tool, wouldn’t it be easier to create an analytics application for ecommerce marketing departments? Or a sales forecasting app? I want to get back to the basics—helping the actual business people who provide actual business value.” 

In the analytics market, this our version of the [bundling and unbundling pendulum](https://stratechery.com/outline/bundling-and-unbundling/). We make [generic BI tools](https://www.oracle.com/business-analytics/business-intelligence/technologies/bi.html); we make [department-specific applications](https://www.oracle.com/business-analytics/business-intelligence/technologies/bi-applications/). When we get tired of making “custom tools [that] help others look at very narrow, specific datasets,” we [make more generic BI tools](https://review.firstround.com/the-inside-story-of-how-this-startup-turned-a-216-word-pitch-email-into-a-2-6-billion-acquisition/); then we make [department-specific applications](https://www.santacruztechbeat.com/2015/09/23/looker-delivers-a-data-platform-with-looker-blocks/) again. 

Over most of the last decade, general-purpose tools were the cool thing to build. Rather than tracking, storing, and reporting on product usage in Mixpanel and tracking, storing, and reporting on sales metrics in Salesforce, we tried to store all our data in one centralized warehouse, and report* *on all of our data using a universal analytics layer. This was one of the motivating beliefs behind the modern data stack: [Pivot the vertically-integrated tools sideways](https://benn.substack.com/p/datas-horizontal-pivot), and replace them with horizontal platforms.

[Ah, whoops.](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/is-the-modern-data-stack-still-a) So now we’re swinging back the other way, and business apps are trendy again. Between 2023 and 2024, [Matt Turck’s data landscape](https://mattturck.com/mad2024/) grew by 42 percent, from 1,416 companies to 2,011 companies. The general-purpose analytics categories—BI, data visualization, and data analyst platforms—grew by only 26 percent, but domain-specific categories—product, sales, marketing, finance, HR, legal, and customer experience—grew by 56 percent.[^6] 

It’s the circle of life in Silicon Valley: Bundle, unbundle; centralize, decentralize; pivot horizontally, pivot vertically. Build multipurpose analytics and BI platforms that are sold to data teams; build domain-specific tools that prestructure common departmental data sources and predefine popular business metrics. Do your analysis freehand; trace a ready-made [template](https://benn.substack.com/p/when-are-templates-going-to-happen). Alternate between the two forms of BI. Though each cycle works a little better than the last, nothing fundamentally changes. 

# Generally accepted analytics principles

There’s another way to describe this oscillation. A [friend of mine](https://twitter.com/thenanyu)[^7] has a theory that all enterprise software should do one of two things: 

Final Cut Pro and Photoshop are the first type of tool. They make it (relatively) easy for filmmakers and artists to turn the ideas in their head into images on a screen. But Final Cut doesn’t tell editors *how *to make those images, and Photoshop doesn’t box in designers around some Adobe-imposed best practices. These tools, and tons more like them, are microphones for their users’ skills—they both amplify [greatness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWc7vYjgnTs), and are unforgiving of [mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMA2iF6RuXk).

We use the second type of software for protection. People need to pay our taxes; TurboTax fills out their forms and makes sure they’re right (powered by [TurboTax® CompleteCheck™](https://turbotax.intuit.com/personal-taxes/online/live/)!). Managers need to keep their teams aligned around a set of goals; Lattice not only helps them track those goals, but encourages that they do it in a [very particular way](https://lattice.com/goals). If you try to use Lattice to manage people using some [deranged goal-setting](https://twitter.com/bennstancil/status/1337105608571490305) framework instead of one they sanctioned, the tool will get in your way. And that’s the point—to tell us what to do, and protect us from our creative flights of fancy. 

In the data market, open-ended products like Mode, Hex, and even Excel fit into the first category. These tools give analysts code editors and spreadsheets, and let people do whatever they want with them—model quarterly discounted future cash flows, [paint pictures](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2017/12/tatsuo-horiuchi-excel-artist/), [nuke the global economy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-18/faq-reinhart-rogoff-and-the-excel-error-that-changed-history), whatever. They’re products for quantitative creativity. 

BI, however, is more complicated. [Most BI tools have two major components](https://benn.substack.com/p/llms-shouldnt-write-sql?utm_source=publication-search#footnote-anchor-2-141968654:~:text=Most%20BI%20tools,of%20their%20results.): first, a data model in which people define metrics, and how they should be calculated; and second, an interface where people choose which metrics they want to see and how they want to visualize them. The former thing defines the rules that govern the latter thing. 

This creates two different experiences, depending on who you are:

Most domain-specific templates and data tools—the stuff we’re flirting with again, now—transform the second “creative” experience into a more governed, “protected” experience. For example, Google Analytics [defines sessions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9191807?hl=en) automatically, according to some unchangeable internal logic. PostHog, a product analytics tool, calculates [retention cohorts](https://posthog.com/docs/product-analytics/retention) based on some methodology of their choosing. [SaaSGrid](https://www.saasgrid.com/analysis) has “all the pre-built transformations you need: Date ranges, Live vs Contracted ARR, Trailing Average, Retention Baselines, S&M:Sales Offsets, Expenses Segmentation.” 

That’s one way to think of the BI pendulum. When data teams are popular, generic BI tools are popular, because they give analysts more freedom to define the rules. When data teams fall out of favor, domain-specific tools—which outsource those rules to the product’s designers—start to look more appealing. 

Which, as a pattern of behavior, I guess makes sense. But I’m not sure it’s *useful.* 

Most of these tools are trying to find the right balance of protection and creativity in how data is modeled and how metrics are defined. The implicit theory here is that companies struggle to turn messy data into consistent and appropriate metrics, and if we can combine the right mix of opinionated best practices with flexible customization, we can all become the [data-driven enterprises that we’ve been promised](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-data-driven-enterprise-of-2025).[^9] 

The problem, however, is that this isn’t what makes successful data-driven companies successful. Amazon isn’t Amazon because it’s great at *defining* metrics. It’s Amazon because it’s great at *interpreting* them. Sure, sometimes we [miscount how many pizzas we sold](https://www.wsj.com/articles/shh-companies-are-fixing-accounting-errors-quietly-11575541981), or [conflate gross margin with contribution margin](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-software-companies-actually-have/comment/54601443). But these aren’t the places where most of us need the most help. We’ve spent thirty years building tools to help us answer our questions. The much harder thing is knowing what to do with those answers once we have them. 

# Opinionated business interpretation

A couple weeks ago, Cedric Chin and Sam Taylor [launched a new tool](https://commoncog.com/introducing-xmrit/), called Xmrit, for creating XmR charts. We talked about these charts [a few months ago](https://benn.substack.com/p/data-arithmetic): They’re a type of time-series chart that uses a handful of simple heuristics to tell you when up-and-down variations are worth paying attention to. It’s a data visualization that tells you how to interpret its results.

In other words, Xmrit is a BI tool that protects you from *misunderstanding* data. There is no restriction on the data that goes into the tool—you can copy and paste any numbers that you want. But once those numbers are in Xmrit, it has strong opinions about how you should interpret them.

Most BI tools are the inverse. They govern inputs, and provide no guidance on how to make sense of the outputs. And so we screw it up. We screw it up because data interpretation is hard; because [the line wiggles](https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-first-principles/); because [most analysis](https://mcorrell.medium.com/exploratory-data-analysis-is-mostly-just-vibes-man-04a3ce6c77c5) is just squinting and [directional vibes](https://benn.substack.com/p/disband-the-analytics-team?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=the%20analytical%20decisions%20that%20executives%20make%20are%20mostly%20based%20on%20these%20sorts%20of%20directional%20vibes). 

Xmrit and XmR charts are one example of what a new approach could look like. There are others:

Just as tools like [Linear](https://linear.app/) are unafraid to tell us how we should build software, BI tools could be bolder in telling us how to think about our business. Tell us how to interpret a time-series chart; force us to think about decomposing our business into its important components; give us a rigid summary table of our business that encourages us to debate what we do about the numbers on the page and now how we graph them; impose frameworks on us, and make us choose one. 

Of course, not every model would be right for every company; Linear’s probably not right for everyone either. But that seems like a better way to buy software—choose it for its strongest opinions, not for its generic features. 

If I had to guess, all of this is the real reason why BI tools [are a tar pit](https://twitter.com/mattarderne/status/1782759973799211142):[^10] They solve the wrong problem. They’re focused on protecting us from bad inputs, and don’t do nearly enough to stop us from screwing up the outputs. And until one does that, we’ll keep feeling frustrated, keep churning through tools, and keep wondering why nothing seems to work. 

Maybe it’s time to try another approach. Stop giving us more exploratory interfaces to get lost in. Stop waiting for us to become “data literate.” Assume we aren’t, and won’t be for a long time. If we were jaded about *that*, what would we build then?[^11]

Back then, if you were a jaded forty-something-year-old tech *female* executive, you were probably Sheryl Sandberg, Marissa Mayer, or Meg Whitman.

[^2]: Florida? [Florida!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEssK8o3jKg) I need to forget, so take me to Florida! I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida! What a crush, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida!

[^3]: Hard, it turns out. Your [corporate rebrand](https://www.cheerfulegg.com/2022/12/03/why-does-everything-look-the-same/) ruins each car wash’s quirky charm; customers are upset that the owner Cheryl got replaced by a carpetbagger, and that shop attendant Donna got replaced with an iPad. You eventually realize that you don’t know anything about car washes and that Cheryl actually ran a very tight ship. You end up selling all the car washes to [a real private equity firm](https://twitter.com/anuatluru/status/1783567586317221930) at a loss, and become the CRO of an enterprise AI security company.

[^4]: You never start the venture studio. There were lots of good meetings. We all got excited. [The whole thing we got excited about is never going to happen](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1783414225274302926).

[^5]: Ok, fine, this one might actually be kind of fun.

[^6]: Another way to [lie with statistics](https://benn.substack.com/p/a-better-way-to-lie-with-statistics): Make a point and confidently back it up with some mostly irrelevant numbers.

[^7]: This blog is 25 percent Griff hype (speaking of, a new album! [Announced yesterday!](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6MLx2JIL7h) Out on July 19!), 35 percent overwritten ledes about venture capitalists, and 40 percent ideas that I stole from Nan.

[^8]: [Or if you](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124017011/ef20025355_10k.htm) do “not currently, and may never, collect, monitor or report certain key operating metrics used by companies in similar industries” and your management and board “does not anticipate relying on any particular key performance metric to make business or operating decisions,” your BI tool won’t care either.

[^9]: Omni, a new BI tool, makes this argument pretty explicitly. They have a Venn diagram [on their homepage](https://omni.co/) that positions Omni as being a combination of being flexible and governed; [they say](https://omni.co/about) they’re the “only business intelligence platform that combines the consistency of a shared data model with the speed and freedom of SQL.”

[^10]: Well, that and [data visualization black hole](https://benn.substack.com/i/134863380/twenty-pages-of-context-in-a-ten-page-window).

[^11]: I mean, we’d probably a startup studio for incubating AI companies.

# The SaaS counterculture

*And the SaaS status symbol.*

—

Unfortunately for the [Humane Ai Pin](https://humane.com/) and the [rabbit r1](https://www.rabbit.tech/), it wasn’t the good sort of immortality. Three weeks ago, [Marques Brownlee](https://www.youtube.com/@mkbhd), a wildly popular YouTuber who goes by MKBHD, [reviewed the Humane Pin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA), a portable AI device that’s supposed to help you with tasks throughout your day. He did not like it. “This [thing is bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA&t=499s) at almost everything it does, basically all of the time,” he said. “[Nobody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA&t=1383s) should buy this device right now.” It’s “the worst product I’ve ever reviewed.”

The video went viral, until it was outdone by this week’s [review of the rabbit r1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddTV12hErTc). According to MKBHD, the r1, a portable AI device that’s supposed to help you with tasks throughout your day, “has [a lot in common](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddTV12hErTc&t=11s) with the Humane Ai Pin”—mainly, that it “is [also bad](https://youtu.be/ddTV12hErTc?si=TO7oAvJP4PGDILMs&t=222) at a lot of stuff.” Like the Humane Pin, it has limited capabilities, frustrating interfaces, and its core feature—answering questions about what’s around you—is slow and unreliable. It’s an alpha product, he said, sold at general availability prices. 

Towards the end of the review, MKBHD asked a bigger question about these AI products: “[What are we doing here?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddTV12hErTc&t=844s)”[^1]

> A lot of these tech companies are developing tech kinda backwards. They're delivering such unfinished products, that it actually makes them nearly impossible to review.
> Like, it feels like it used to just be, make the thing, and then put it on sale. Now, it's like, put it on sale, and then deliver the half-baked thing, and then iterate and make it better, and hopefully with enough updates, then it's ready, and it's what we promised way back when we first started selling it. And then this whole period in the middle is a mess.

He goes on to say it’s happening with other, more mature hardware products too. There’s “one major feature of every smartphone launch that gets announced, but that's not coming until later in the year.” And cars, which now run tons of software as well, are getting delivered in “a half-finished state, where you just don't get a lot of the features that you paid for.”

A bit later, he speculates on what’s causing this trend: AI products need data to train their models.[^2] Though these devices are hardware products, they’re increasingly differentiated by the software that powers them—i.e, the capabilities of their AI agents—and *not* the technology in the physical machine that you buy. Most of this software runs entirely in the cloud.[^3] Moreover, whatever software that runs on the device itself, like its operating system or any local AI models, can be regularly refreshed via downloadable updates. Nikon couldn’t ship a busted [D50 digital SLR camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D50) in 2005, because the consumer had to use what was in the box, and only what was in the box. But today, Humane and rabbit can ship a busted camera, and fix it in post. 

Which is, of course, exactly how SaaS products also work. 

In other words, the new delivery model for hardware tech—a relatively simple box, and complex software served remotely—is the same as just about every modern web application. It's just that in the latter case, the box is a Chrome browser rather than a [nuclear orange](https://www.rabbit.tech/rabbit-r1?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=US_brand_benefit_0327&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwltKxBhDMARIsAG8KnqVjCUoxE8YlQd7zhQ8iHbJ-rHTRNUjx8WXtAOLZFtkrHe-2DaVX1e8aAtIbEALw_wcB) [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_SP). And if that model is encouraging hardware makers to ship underdone products, are the incentives not the same for SaaS vendors? 

Or, more bluntly—while we're on the topic of [questioning the entire SaaS business model](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-software-companies-actually-have)—are SaaS products worse than the software we bought in a box?

Having worked with a lot of SaaS companies, I can at least say that it's not a totally unreasonable question. Most SaaS vendors are relatively lax about bugs, and use their customers as their primary quality assurance teams.[^4] It’s probably a rational decision, too—why spend weeks testing for every possible bug and rough edge when you can crowdsource that work to your users, and, in theory, quickly fix whatever issues they find? Though you could argue that the customer won't like paying you to be any your unwitting guinea pig—and they won't—they’ll probably tolerate it, especially as this sort of practice becomes the norm. Vendors ship incomplete software, the threshold for what makes a bad release slips a bit further, and the whole thing spirals in a slow devolutionary loop, until [people are blaming reviewers](https://twitter.com/dvassallo) for not liking useless garbage, because of some open-ended promise that it might one day not be useless. 

All together, it’s a bad pattern for both customers and companies. Customers get shoddy software. And companies get stuck on an unsustainable financial treadmill, where they have to keep building just to keep up with what they’ve sold. For SaaS businesses, that keeps them from [ever operating in](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-software-companies-actually-have#:~:text=Given%20the%20highly,significant%20operating%20leverage.) “maturity mode”—i.e., the period when they actually make money. 

Which makes me wonder—will the SaaS model be as enduring as we all seem to assume that it will be? The financial math might not add up. The prevalence of the subscription services—from B2B vendors, from content providers, from individuals who want to monetize their personal brands through newsletters, Twitch channels, and fan accounts—is creating a lot of [subscription fatigue](https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/consumer-spending-streaming-services-svod-deloitte-digital-trends-1235582760/).[^5] And if SaaS vendors are incentivized to make lower quality, less complete products than software-in-a-box vendors, it’s inevitable that those incentives will eventually trickle into the software that gets shipped to customers. 

None of which is to say SaaS is bad, or doomed, or whatever. It just seems that, at some point, the fad will go through some sort of countercyclical contraction, if for no other reason than companies will try to differentiate themselves by being weird. There are already some cracks. Monthly subscription fees are slowly shifting towards metered, usage-based fees.[^6] 37signals, a company that tries to differentiate itself [by being weird](https://37signals.com/), recently introduced an option to buy—[not lease, buy](https://once.com/)—their software with a one-time fee. 

If I were thinking about starting another software company, I’d be tempted to do the same.[^7] Build something that you don’t have to keep building forever; *sell* the product [based on what it is today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddTV12hErTc&t=1151s) and not based on what you can promise it’ll be in the future. If MKBHD is right, there’s a lot of appeal in that, and a market for it that’s waiting to be sold to.

Ultimately, that’s the interesting question here: Will someone pull this off? Will someone build a big software company that *isn’t *a SaaS product?[^8] Will there be another Salesforce that does to the cloud what Salesforce [did to self-hosted, perpetual license software](https://benn.substack.com/p/is-bi-dead?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=In%20a%20word,these%20questions%20entirely.)? And if there is, how many other new companies will decide that that’s the new thing to copy?

I don’t know. But as a software *customer *who doesn’t want to buy stuff based on roadmaps and upcoming releases, I hope so. Because hope isn’t optimism. [Hope is a thing with features.](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42889/hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers-314)

# Status software 

Speaking of things with features, back in 2008, a software developer released [an iPhone app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich) called *I Am Rich*. When you opened the app, it showed you a picture of a glowing red gem. There was a single button below the gem; when you tapped it, [the app told you this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os2axzJHbzA):

> I am richI deserv itI am good,healthy & successful

It cost $999.99.

In the App Store, *I Am Rich *[described itself](https://www.wired.com/2008/08/eight-people-bo/) as a “work of art with no hidden function at all.” In a review, the *New York Times *[described the app](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/11/technology/11apple.html) as a “downloadable program that promised to do nothing except signal to the world that its buyer was wealthy enough to have spent $1,000 to download an image of a multifaceted ruby.” A day after the app was released—and after eight people bought it—Apple removed the app from the App Store, and [said nothing at all](https://www.latimes.com/archives/blogs/technology-blog/story/2008-08-07/apple-removes-1-000-featureless-iphone-application).[^9] 

Ok, I have some questions:

I have no idea what the answer is to any of these questions. It seems like Apple wouldn’t ban the NFT factory,[^10] *and* people might actually buy it?[^11] But it seems like Apple probably *would *ban both the overpriced calculator and the cask-aged clock, for the same undisclosed reason it banned *I Am Rich*? And, even if Apple approved those two apps, I doubt people would buy them?

Which is all at least a little weird! The first app does nothing; it’s *I Am Rich*, built for the [laser-eyed crypto goons](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/laser-eyes-bitcoin-trend-laserrayuntil100k). The second app is just the first app, but it does something—and somehow, that functionality seems like it would make it *less* appealing and *more* of a gimmick. And the third app is basically an exclusive luxury good, which is an exceedingly normal thing for people to want. If Rolex can produce [a million watches a year](https://www.horando.de/en/en/watch-magazine/how-many-watches-rolex-produces-a-year) and sell them [at a huge premium as a status symbol](https://lonelywrist.com/decoding-the-margins-of-the-watch-industry-exploring-pricing-and-profitability/), why can’t some software maker do the same?[^12] 

Put differently, on this last point, why isn’t there status software?

It could be that software doesn’t cost anything to manufacture on the margin, and people won’t pay luxury prices for something that’s easy to make. But [perfume is cheap to produce](https://www.aol.com/2012/05/22/celebrity-perfume-cost-breakdown/). Plus, *developing *software *is* very expensive, even, [in some ways](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-software-companies-actually-have), on the margin. 

It could be that software isn’t scarce—if everyone can own a thing, nobody will feel special for owning it. But that doesn’t really work either. Software *could* be scarce, either by choice or through some [blockchain hocus pocus](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/). Software isn’t scarce because its makers don’t want it to be, which begs the question as to why that is.

It could be that people only want to pay luxury prices for craftsmanship, like a [wearable three-burner gas grill](https://jacobandco.com/timepieces/bugatti-chiron-tourbillon).[^13] Loro Piana enthusiasts want to [dress like Kendall Roy](https://www.esquire.com/style/mens-fashion/a43963172/kendall-roy-succession-funeral-loro-piana-coat/) *and *to [ensconce themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgmiGN2mi2M) in an “extraordinary blend of two cashmere fabrics fused together…that is not only luxurious, [but exceptionally rich and enveloping](https://us.loropiana.com/en/p/woman/outerwear-jackets/lamar-jacket-FAO0525?colorCode=D0D3).” But that makes the lack of status software even more mysterious. Software is, quite literally, meticulously engineered. Most applications have far more than [57 complications](https://www.prestigetime.com/blog/worlds-most-complicated-watch.html). And if that’s not enough—or if the software is still “too cheap” to manufacture for it to qualify as a luxury good—just add more.[^14] 

It could be that those additional complications aren’t useful; expensive stuff needs to be useful. [But I mean, please.](https://www.prada.com/ww/en/p/money-clip/2RC001_UGB_F0118)

It could be that software isn’t conspicuous enough. Status symbols only work if they’re visible; how do you show off your Balenciaga web browser, or your Tiffany to-do list? First, there are [lots](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-remove-sent-from-my-iphone-signature/) [of](https://help.superhuman.com/article/460-sent-via-superhuman) [ways](https://twitter.com/lessin/status/1486477359717187589) to tell other people what software you’re using. Second, most luxury goods exist solely to be status symbols. Necklaces weren’t practical things that eventually became status symbols; people [created necklaces](https://www.thenaturalsapphirecompany.com/education/necklaces-and-pendants-brief-history/) to [be conspicuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNcEK5x1fKs). If we want to show off the software we bought, we don’t have to make our note-taking app public; we could just create some other “category” of software that was designed for other people to see. 

It could be that software just isn’t cool. We don’t brag about orthodontia brands, because orthodontia is embarrassing. Perhaps software is the same. This seems closer, though it still seems incomplete—why isn’t software cool? There’s nothing awkward about admitting you use a computer. If having [the right water bottle](https://www.tiktok.com/@tanahdelores/video/7316907217247145258) can make you cool, why can’t some app on the phone that we stare at for [seven hours a day](https://dcdx.co/the-2023-gen-z-screen-time-report) be cool too?

It could be because software *makers *aren’t cool.[^15] Computers used to be nerd stuff. Though people have [favorable opinions](https://www.forbes.com/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands/#3e9de17c119c) about today’s tech companies, they haven’t fully shed that legacy. This seems like the most plausible explanation. Because of software’s origins, software as a status symbol had [a cold start problem](https://a16z.com/books/the-cold-start-problem/): It wasn’t originally cool, so we never made it scarce, so it never became cool. The nerdy brand evolved into [cheery egalitarian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgGAZOIHxTs) one instead of [edgy detached](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG-nnDlnWrA) one, so efforts to make it cool felt forced. And so, even though there’s nothing inherently weird about a celebrity endorsing IBM Watson, it feels weird when [Serena Williams endorses IBM Watson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRLwM3QnDZ4).

But could that change? If someone built an expensive photo-organizing app, paid Billie Eilish to use it but not shill for it, and arranged some paparazzi photos of her scrolling through it, could you astroturf a luxury software market?[^16] [It works for shorts.](https://www.wsj.com/style/fashion/taylor-swift-sells-out-clothes-brands-2dfb3652)[^17] Or, what if instead of a bunch of software engineers trying to make a cool app, a “cool” company tried to make a cool app? LVMH makes thousands of products; why not make a calendar app too? 

Maybe that’s where the real answer to all of these questions are: Inside LVMH’s boardroom. [They have staggering amounts of money.](https://www.lvmh.com/investors/profile/financial-indicators/#groupe) If they wanted to make software, they could. If they wanted to hire some designers and engineers, they have tons of perks that they could offer that Google and Facebook couldn’t. So why haven’t they? They know status symbols better than anyone else in the world. Why can’t software be one?

[^1]: Shoutout to [Derek Steer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dereksteer/) for sending this to me.

[^2]: [From the video:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddTV12hErTc&t=1099s)Look back at the beginning of when Tesla started shipping cars with all the autopilot stuff. They were selling cars, and they got popular for other reasons. It was a good electric car with good range, and a good charging network.And then people started sort of beta testing this autopilot stuff, and Tesla starts collecting millions of miles and hours of data, from how it works in the real world. And so all of that data helped their systems learn, and get the head start that they need, on trying to make the best autopilot software.So the Rabbit, I'm sure, would like to use their price advantage [it costs 200 dollars, compared to the 700 dollar Humane Pin], and get as many of them out into the real world as possible, into people's hands, so they can start beta testing, and having it trained and getting good at a variety of tasks.

[^3]: This was one of MKBHD’s big complaints about these devices. They’re very slow, because when you ask it a question or take a picture of something you want it to identify, that data is sent to and interpreted in the cloud, rather than on the device itself.

[^4]: Not all SaaS vendors! I’m sure someone will email me and say that *their* company is passionate about quality, and that *they *are customer-obsessed. Which, sure. But also, it’s undeniable that the SaaS model at least lowers the incentive for software vendors to worry about quality. And [as Charlie Munger said](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11903426-show-me-the-incentive-and-i-ll-show-you-the-outcome), show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome.

[^5]: Counterpoint: [The youths don’t mind.](https://www.marketingcharts.com/customer-centric/spending-trends-229253#:~:text=Gen%20Z%20adults%20are%20the%20most%20likely%20to%20feel%20content%20(57%25)%20and%20the%20least%20likely%20to%20feel%20overwhelmed%20(33%25)%20with%20the%20current%20availability%20of%20subscriptions%2C)

[^6]: For example, most early SaaS products charged a per month fee for every user who had an account on their service. Then, companies ([popularized by Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/218915077-Slacks-Fair-Billing-Policy), I think) started charging only for users who *used* the product. And now, SaaS companies are moving towards volume-based pricing, where you pay for [every row of data](https://airbyte.com/pricing) you sync, [table you monitor](https://www.montecarlodata.com/request-for-pricing/), or [second of compute](https://modal.com/pricing) you use.

[^7]: I mean, no, if I were thinking about starting another software company, I would get myself lobotomized.

[^8]: To be clear, my hypothetical company won’t be this company, because nobody, me most of all, wants there to be such a thing.

[^9]: If you want to participate in a performance art project, [there is no app for that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szrsfeyLzyg).

[^10]: If nothing else, I doubt Apple would ban an app that was free to download and did nothing but offer you a bespoke NFT to buy for $999.99. Which is functionally the same thing as a $999.99 app that generates an NFT, which is functionally the same thing as *I Am Rich*.

[^11]: Or at least, people [living in 2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) might’ve bought it.

[^12]: Maybe some do? Some invite-only products like [Superhuman](https://medium.com/dare-to-be-better/superhuman-inside-the-worlds-most-exclusive-app-and-its-ridiculous-onboarding-process-d0ad7a63a64), [Clubhouse](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/17/clubhouse-app-invite-what-is-it-how-to-get-audio-chat-elon-musk), [Ello](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141117185503-179918567-i-finally-got-my-ello-invite/), and [Airchat](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-16/audio-social-network-airchat-takes-off-with-the-tech-set) were *exclusive* when they first came out, though they weren’t lasting status symbols. Perhaps, however, that’s how software status works. It’s more like the food scene than the fashion scene. You don’t show off by consistently using some enduring high-status brand; you show off by always having access to the hot new thing before anyone else does.

[^13]: Or is it a wearable Hot Wheels car? I don’t know.

[^14]: There is, of course, *expensive* software. Usually, however, expensive software is expensive because it does more and works better than cheap software. I’m not aware of any software that’s expensive because people want to show off its logo in their browser tabs when they share their screens on calls.

[^15]: Like, *I* make software.

[^16]: [“My baby want a Box subscription.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7bQwwqW-Hc)

[^17]: [Did it happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPqDIwWMtxg) for [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/euphoria)??? Does Kendrick Lamar actually use Merriam-Webster over Dictonary.com?? Did Merriam-Webster pay for this?? Did it work?? I have so many questions.

*We worry about analysis, but maybe attention really is all you need. *

A few months ago, [I said there were two ways](https://benn.substack.com/p/avg-text) to figure out how to fix a failing bar:[^1] 

I thought that option two was better, and [AI might make it better still](https://benn.substack.com/p/avg-text). But there’s actually a third option that I didn’t think of: You could *watch* people. You could sit in the corner of the bar with a notepad, and write down everything you see. The point isn’t to quantify it—that’s just manual data capture—but to actively listen, and see if you notice anything surprising. Watch what customers order; what they do; what types of people come in your door. [Do you notice patterns?](https://www.tiktok.com/@_sophiereich_/video/7275843741397650730)[^2] When your [DJ](https://www.youtube.com/@djearworm)[^3] starts their set, does it [get the people going](https://www.tiktok.com/@andrepower/video/7365984429019352350), or do they [start shopping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLnlXAIdWw0) on their phones? Though your conclusions may not be “statistically significant,” or even quantifiable, they still have force. You don't need to know how to define dancing to know when [something is a banger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YghDpAEECs8).[^4] 

On one hand, this third option is terrible, because it’s a combination of the worst elements of the other two. Observations, like the behavioral datasets that you, are an indirect way to understand customers’ opinions. But unlike working with data, observation is hard to scale. At the end of a night of note-taking, there’s no way to aggregate up what you saw into precise facts and figures. It’s analysis by anecdote, math by memory, and inference by vibe. We can add up structured [likes and dislikes](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6pzEgtu2q9), but we don’t have a way to “average” [200,000 freeform comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJeY-FXidDQ)[^5]—and we don’t have a way to average eight hours of passive observation either. The best we can do is watch, and then ask ourselves if we remember seeing anything interesting.

On the other hand, watching customers includes some of the best parts of user research and of data analysis. Like behavioral logs, observations are revealed preference; they are “true,” and not self-reported representations that [may not always be entirely honest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QiFl9Dc7D0&t=357s). Moreover, unlike behavioral logs, observations can capture things that are difficult to quantify, or things we haven’t thought to quantify.[^6] 

Perhaps most importantly, though, watching customers can reveal surprising results that *we didn’t think to ask about. *This is one of the biggest problems with traditional data analysis. The insights hidden in it like the [Isla de Muerta](https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Isla_de_Muerta): They can’t be found except by those who already know where they are. User research and open-ended feedback forms don’t have that problem—and neither does watching customers from the corner of a bar. If you watch for long enough, and remember what you see well enough, you’d probably see a lot of things that you never would’ve thought to look for. 

Of course, that’s a big if. You have a bar to tend; you can’t actually spend all night [terrorizing your customers with your furious note-taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zpv8grBiM). It’s also hard to remember everything you see, and your conclusions, though emergent, would likely be plagued by [recency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias) and [availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic) biases.  

But what if you had an army of invisible watchmen, with a notepad long enough to perfectly record every detail they saw, and with a memory sharp enough to be able to recall all of it at once? What if you could ask that omniscient thing what *it *saw that was interesting and surprising? What if you had three tools for saving your bar—a database of numbers to analyze, a library of customer interviews, or this third thing, a thing that watches everything, remembers all of it, and finds patterns in the noise—which would you choose?[^7]

I mean, you might not always choose the third one, but it’d be a pretty nice option to have. Because it’s not data analysis, exactly, but it’s something bigger: *It’s the goal of data analysis.* Most analysis is meant to find these sorts of patterns in charts and graphs. What if we didn’t need the numbers at all, but we could just watch and remember?

# Attention is all you have

When ChatGPT first came out, [a](https://julius.ai/) [whole](https://datagpt.com/) [bunch](https://www.getdot.ai/) [of](https://www.narrative.bi/ai-data-analyst) [startups](https://talktodata.ai/) immediately tried to use it to help analysts with option one. On the surface, that made sense: Companies have enormous haystacks of data, there are (allegedly) patterns in that data, and LLMs are built on top of literally every recorded idea in human history. If something could connect the dots in our datasets, it would be ChatGPT.

So far, it hasn’t really worked. According to dbt Labs’ recent survey of data professionals, [only a third](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/how-is-the-state-of-analytics-engineering) of them are using AI in their daily workflows, and I’d guess a much smaller fraction of them are using it to do analysis directly. As [Seth Stephens-Davidowitz said of his book](https://benn.substack.com/p/playing-for-ourselves) *Who Makes the NBA?: Data-Driven Answers to Basketball's Biggest Questions*—which he wrote in thirty days with heavy support from ChatGPT—though AI “eliminates all the parts of my job or work process that I hate [like] cleaning datasets, merging datasets,” its “current capabilities in correlating [its] extensive knowledge to generate new theories or uncover complex patterns were limited.” 

In hindsight, that also makes sense. A lot of analysis is logical reasoning. It’s asking, “Why might people not like my bar?,” and thinking through the possible causes. To do that, you need a rough theory of how bars work, and what people like, and how those things are connected.  

Large language models only *appear* to use theory and reason. Instead, what makes them powerful is that they have incredible memories. If you ask ChatGPT to write a blog post that’s full of subliminal messages that compel people to buy technology stocks, it will recall an enormous corpus of blog posts. It will find texts that it associates with subliminal messages. It will fetch everything it knows about technology stocks.[^8] And it will then smash them all together [into a post](https://chat.openai.com/share/b990cb1f-0afe-4ec0-8326-df57ff0e3c02) that represents a rough average of every related piece of content that’s ever been written.[^9] It doesn’t know what the prompt it was given *means*;[^10] it only knows how to create something that fits the prior patterns of everything it’s observed.

In some very rough sense, that’s what LLMs are—engines for finding patterns in words. But the underlying [transformer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)) behind LLMs can be applied to any sorts of sequences.[^11] ChatGPT and other LLMs take input text, break it up into small chunks, turn those chucks into complex mathematical objects, and predict, based on historical patterns, what should come next. People have already built models that do the same thing for [audio](https://suno.com/) and [video](https://pika.art/home), using essentially the same architecture.[^12] They listen to and watch everything, remember all of it, and reproduce the patterns that they see. 

If we can build models that do for audio and video what LLMs did for text, could we build the same sorts of models on behavioral data? Could AI save my bar, not via LLMs cosplaying as analysts writing SQL queries,[^13] but via transformers trained directly on sequences of customer purchases and interactions? 

# Large data models

I guess we’ll find out. Earlier this year, Motif Analytics[^14] announced that they’re building [foundation models of event sequences](https://www.motifanalytics.com/posts/foundation-models-product-analytics): 

> To model event sequences with minimal changes to the underlying data, our approach is to mimic the training of LLMs on text data but with two key modifications:
> These architectures comprise what we are calling Generalized Large Event Analytics models (✨GLEAM✨).

Motif is building a model that takes streams of product event data—which includes the event itself *and* attributes about the event, like who the user was, the device they were using, how long they’ve been a user, and so on—breaks those events into chunks, and turns those chucks into complex mathematical objects. They then use the same transformer architecture that powers LLMs to predict what events are likely to come next, based on what happened, who did it, and the context in which they did it. It’s a machine for observing everything, and finding patterns. 

Will it work? I have no idea. Training LLMs is still very hard, and requires a lot of finessing and fine-tuning to get right. Training a similar model on events is surely even harder. There’s also no internet of event logs to scrape. This whole idea could be crazy.

But I’m intrigued, because it’s one of the first efforts I’ve seen that attempts to apply [the bitter lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) to analytical problems. GLEAM isn’t trying “to make systems that worked the way the researchers thought their own minds worked;” it’s not trying to build [knowledge or theory into AI agents](https://roundup.getdbt.com/i/142548734/third-mamba-and-jepa); it’s not trying to do analysis by making computers act like analysts. Instead, it treats AI like what it is: a blistering calculator with a breathtaking memory. It’s feeding patterns into a pattern-generation machine. And it’s saying that maybe people can get what they* want* from analysis—an understanding of the patterns in the world around us—without actually *doing* analysis, or even directly touching data. 

Which is perhaps exactly what we need. [The numbers may have been the problem all along.](https://benn.substack.com/p/disband-the-analytics-team#:~:text=Perhaps%20that%E2%80%99s%20actually%20what%E2%80%99s%20held%20us%20back%20for%20so%20long%3A%20numbers%2C%20more%20or%20less.) Data quality is really hard.[^15] [Math is even harder.](https://twitter.com/bcrypt/status/1788406218937229780) Let’s be humble, and get [some help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QIZE708gJ4).[^16] Transformers, if applied directly on top of the behaviors we want to find patterns in, could finally be what saves our bad bar—even if [they couldn’t](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/drake-removes-taylor-made-freestyle-ai-tupac-snoop-1235667030/) save some people from [theirs](https://genius.com/31652831).

[^4]: These [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YghDpAEECs8) reaction [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuhjP8YbScE) are good examples of how option three is different from options one and two. If you wanted to figure out how people felt about the two songs, you could try to measure it with data. But using what metric? Head nods? Smiles versus aghast stares? How would you even track that? Or, if you preferred option two, you could ask peole what they thought of each song. They’d probably give somewhat political answers though, based on what they thought other people thought about them, and based on how they felt about the overall beef. But if you just watched the video and looked for informal patterns, it’s very easy to figure out [the vibe](https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkxgq1jmio0nfOrYIs6zm6MQIhlUF4rwyqT).

[^6]: I.e., the stuff in the reaction videos.

[^7]: I guess you also have a fourth option for saving a bad bar, which is to [write a song](https://twitter.com/ZeoVGM/status/1787296701490819536) that says, nuh uh, the [pub](https://itsalwayssunny.fandom.com/wiki/Paddy%27s_Pub) isn’t bad, actually. I doubt it would work, but Stranger Things [have happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJeY-FXidDQ&t=187s).

[^8]: This isn’t exactly true. LLMs only appear to have incredible memories too. There is no database of every book that’s ever been written in ChatGPT; it can’t “remember” all of *Moby Dick*. Instead, there is a giant predictive model that’s been trained on every book that’s ever been written, and *Moby Dick—*and everything else—alters inside the weights in that model.

[^9]: Less generously, [it will crush centuries of human creativity and expression](https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1787864325258162239) into a [single sterile screen](https://jacobbacharach.com/2024/05/08/happiness-or-not-at-all/).

[^10]: If you need proof that ChatGPT has no theory about what words actually mean, it called the blog post that was supposed to subliminally convince people to buy technology stocks “Unleashing Future Potential: Why Investing in Technology Stocks is a Smart Move.” Though, fair, I guess it would’ve been easier to brainwash Derek Zoolander to kill the prime minister of Malaysia with a song called *Derek Zoolander, go kill the prime minister of Malaysia *than with one called *[Relax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjsjHzh815Q).*

[^11]: I think? I should caveat this by saying that I have no idea what I’m actually talking about. My career as a proper data scientist started and ended with scoring a few A/B tests [using high school statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) written in raw SQL, so I’m making most of this up as I go.

In this work, we consider how generative models of visual data can inherit such benefits. Whereas LLMs have text tokens, Sora has visual *patches*. Patches have previously been shown to be an effective representation for models of visual data.

[^13]: My brother in Christ, it is the year 2024, why are we still doing [this](https://arslanshahid-1997.medium.com/chatgpt-vs-claude-3-which-is-better-for-text-to-sql-e2eee59ea581)?

[^14]: My only advice: [Drop the “analytics.”](https://mediaoptions.com/blog/on-the-record-why-mode-analytics-acquired-mode-com/) Just, Motif. [It’s cleaner.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEgk2v6KntY)

[^15]: It’s [common](https://blog.dataiku.com/why-data-quality-matters-in-the-age-of-generative-ai) for [people](https://shelf.io/blog/garbage-in-garbage-out-ai-implementation/) to say that generative AI makes data quality even more important. Bad training data makes bad models; garbage in, garbage out; all that. That feels…backwards? Messy data is a problem for computing metrics, because one incorrect bar tab will make your revenue KPI wrong. However, if your goal is to understand patterns, you’re looking for approximations. Tools like Motif could reach the conclusion that customers who spend a lot of money tend to order wine on top of pretty messy data. In some ways, that’s the beauty of transformers. You can stuff a bunch of messy data underneath them and they don’t lose their balance. I mean, ChatGPT is trained *on* *Reddit.*

[^16]: I know it’s rap battle week, but this wasn’t bad? A little disappointing compared to the [teaser](https://www.tiktok.com/@postmalone/video/7361929441620004139) though.

# The design flaw at the heart of every data product

*I'll save you a click: It's because they weren't designed for real data.*

---

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B59Z!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedd20d67-4fae-49f4-a461-e98445f88706_1161x738.png)
*If you know, you know. If you don’t know, no spoilers, go watch The Good Place.*

If you’ve ever seen a demo of a data product, you know the script:

Ava, the CEO of Playful Pines,[^1] opens Slack. A message is waiting for her. It’s from [Janet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5fc07XrFGQ), the AI-enabled chatbot from PowerStrategy BI.[^2] “Here is your Daily Insights report,” Janet says. There are a few tidy charts: A forecast shows revenue on a [clear upward trajectory](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/ProductOverview_WhyPBI_2.3?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=2000&qlt=95&fit=constrain); an uncannily legible area chart shows [sales by marketing channel](https://www.metabase.com/images/product/use-cases/illustration_share_your_insights.png); [a colorful map shows nothing at all](https://www.sisense.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sisense.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F1-ShopSense-Dashboard-new-1.png&w=3840&q=75). But look, Janet say, [sales jumped last night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeDya0qedB8&t=3294s)! Oh my! Ava asks Janet to explain what caused the sudden spike. “Sales of Bumble Blocks are up 600 percent,” Janet says, and shows Ava a chart of sales by product line. There are five lines on the chart. Four of them roll gently up and down, while the line for Bumble Blocks rises distinctly above the rest. The chart is clean; the lines are smooth; the axis is unbroken; the comparisons are easy; the conclusion is obvious. 

Ava is delighted, but worried. [Can we fill all those orders?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNJLpY4rqE8&t=749s) Bumble Blocks are made with real wood; real, *reclaimed* wood. If this trend continues, Playful Pines will need to ramp up production! 

Ava sends a message to Simon, the production manager. Simon is already on it! Janet alerted him about the incoming orders, and his real-time PowerStrategy dashboard says that they have enough inventory for three more days of above-average sales. He’s already preparing to shift production from other toys to Bumble Blocks. But how many new sets do they need? How long will the new orders keep coming in? Ava posts a message to her chief marketing officer: “@meredith, Bumble Blocks is selling out! Do you know where yesterday’s new customers came from?”

Olivia, Playful Pines’ social media manager, quickly chimes in. “ToysWithTaylor posted about Bumble Blocks on TikTok last night! She has 4 million followers!” Olivia shares a PowerStrategy report of Bumble Block orders by referrer; another pristine chart shows that most of last night’s orders came from TikTok. She sends a second graph: “When playtimeOFFICIAL posted about Tilted Towers, the increase in sales lasted about a little over a day, but they only had 600,000 followers. Janet is predicting this could last for as long as a week.” 

Great work everyone, says Ava. She asks Simon to prepare for up to ten days of new orders. She congratulates Olivia on her successful influencer campaigns. Everyone is happy. Playful Pines is up and to the right. Some B-roll shows a smiling kid playing with blocks. Olivia updates her Slack profile from social media manager to marketing director. With PowerStrategy, you can understand your business as well as Ava. You can be as prepared as Simon. You can get promoted like Olivia. You can love your job as much as everyone at Playful Pines. The video closes with an animated PowerStrategy logo [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6zVzWU95Sw&t=137s) [a](https://youtu.be/2Q2lFj3KsBU?si=AzyVNe8ldfqOfG62&t=43) [quirky](https://youtu.be/JRHkNC2kvXs?si=azzPUIF6zqilTk6_&t=31) [sound](https://youtu.be/nUuoommBToQ?si=o6azx4c_dnZXZjRQ&t=37). Delightful. 

# The bad place

Unfortunately, in real life, here's what happens instead:

Ava is the CEO of Red Eye Entertainment, LLC, the obscure parent company of several dozen online gaming brands. They make clones of popular apps like *Candy Crush*, and try to game social media algorithms into making them go viral. They run a secondary business reselling user data to advertisers. 

Ava opens her PowerStrategy dashboard. There are 44 charts. The big one, monthly revenue, is mostly flat. Maybe it’s down? Ava squints. It’s hard to say because May is only half over. Eyeballing it, May looks to be on track to be about the same as April? She scrolls down. Total daily signups are all over the place: 95 yesterday, 455 two days ago, 501 three days ago, 220 the day before. There is a bar chart that shows signups by game; there are 45 series on the chart; it is completely illegible. *Spades with Friends* looks steady. *Smuggler's Run* is doing well? *Operation: Annihilation* and *Hedge Maze* are having down months? 

The marketing funnel is even more incomprehensible. A line chart of signups by source looks like a Jackson Pollock painting. The biggest source is “Unknown.” The second biggest is “Social.” The third biggest is “Twitch - display.” There is also a series called “utm_source=twitter&camp_name=MM-en_ABO_WW_keywords-bitcoin-new-10.05&utm_campaign=46829847&utm_term=gg_v1-cAF_dDT_pic_MM-tm1%28gaming%29_len_p%28fb%29_gM_.”

Weekly active users are up; promising. In-app purchases are down; alarming. The percentage of users playing multiple games is twice as high this month as last month—from 1 percent to 2 percent. One-day retention rates are all over the place; one-month retention rates haven't moved in over a year. Average daily playing time is falling, though recent iOS changes have made tracking it less reliable. Game ratings are rising, though recent Android changes made it harder to collect feedback from users. 

What should Ava do? Which of the four dozen noisy graphs should she drill into? Who knows. Nobody knows. Some charts are up. Some charts are down. Some charts are flat. Most charts look like [Solo Jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_%28design%29). There is no orderly spike of Builder Block sales. There is only noise, and a [useless chatbot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgl3DFbgA78) that [nobody wants](https://benn.substack.com/p/ai-is-coming-for-your-favorite-products). The dashboard is a horoscope, capable of telling whatever story its reader is looking for. The business is turning around. The business is flat. The business is in its death throes, moments from bankruptcy. Well, Ava thinks, it was like this yesterday, and we're still here. Ava moves on.

# Fake data, fake designs

We all design demos around the first story because a demo about the second story would be terrible. Which, sure, fine; demos are supposed to be tight sizzle reels [that skip the boring parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH07_sXyib4&t=420s). The problem, however, is that we also design *products* around the first story.

This happens in two ways. The first is aesthetic—products are literally designed for the first story. [Figma mocks for data products](https://www.numerro.io/guides/dashboard-mockup-guide) almost always show charts with a few well-labeled series. They show tables where every field is nicely formatted and every value fits comfortably in its cell. They show database schema browsers with a reasonable number of tables that are named reasonable things. No designer has ever walked into a product review meeting with mocks of [borked areas charts](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Desktop/Stacked-Area-Charts-look-distorted-Attempting-to-Fill-Missing/m-p/208087?lightbox-message-images-208087=49114iDED25A6DF07C5712), tables [mangled by multi-line HTML](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Desktop/Rendering-HTML-in-Power-BI-table-visualization/td-p/2590568), or schema browsers with [100,000 tables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html#resource-quotas).

Instead, products are designed to *handle* these experiences. They’re designed to encounter one of these issues—a chart full of nulls, a column full of JSON, a schema browser full of tables named nicolle_alexander-walker.dbt_dev.salesforce_opportunity_fields and nicolle_alexander-walker.dbt_dev.salesforce_opportunity_field_history—and *not break*. In a sense, every product is built for the happy path of Playful Pines, full of clean data that makes beautiful charts. But Playful Pines isn’t the default experience; it’s the edge case. Most of us are Red Eye Entertainment, plagued by messy data, erratic metrics, and graphs with too many series. This is why most data products never look as good as the mocks:[^3] It’s not the products that are the problem; it’s the data we put underneath. 

But of course, that data isn’t going to change—especially when [data quality tools](https://www.acceldata.io/data-reliability) are designed for the same [fantasies](https://assets-global.website-files.com/64fef88ee8b22d3d21b715a2/657c1fc39242b65032fc7e28_6495a1132da9387978bddcc2_Acceldata%2520data%2520observability%2520operational%2520intelligence.png).[^4] So it *is* the products’ problem. 

Though I’m not sure how to best solve this, there’s at least one way to start: Make mocks on real data. Find a real dashboard, a real schema, a real dbt project, and a real `marketo_leads` table, and use those things as design templates. If it makes the UI ugly or the experience confusing, *make the UI and the experience better*. Until the nerf data in our designs magically show up in our databases, that reality—not the Playful Pines pipe dream—is the world we need products for. 

# Everything wiggles

But there’s a bigger issue: A product built for Playful Pines solves the wrong problem. 

In that world, Ava needs help finding needles in haystacks. Her business is full of metrics, and she needs to be told of the one that’s moving in a meaningful way. Fundamentally, it’s a problem about search and discovery—it’s about making sure the right people know the right things at the right time. 

That, I think, is a gross misunderstanding of what most businesses need. Their problems are more like Red Eye’s: There are needles everywhere, and they all halfheartedly point in different directions. Not only does [the chart wiggle](https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-first-principles/#:~:text=The%20obstacle%20is%20that%20the%20chart%20wiggles.), 44 of them wiggle. Some wiggle up. Some down. Some wiggle across 20 product SKUs. Some have too many null values to wiggle. Some just say, “Error while reading data, error message: Failed to parse JSON: Unexpected end of string; Unexpected end of string; Expected key.” 

In other words, we aren’t detectives looking for the [single strand of hair](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/15/nyregion/gilgo-beach-murders-dna-hair.html) that explains the entire case. [We’re Benoit Blanc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGqiHJTsRkQ), investigating a murder full of contradictory clues where everyone has a motive. [Interpreting data is hard](https://benn.substack.com/p/bis-third-form#:~:text=The%20problem%2C%20however%2C%20is%20that%20this%20isn%E2%80%99t%20what%20makes%20successful%20data%2Ddriven%20companies%20successful.) because everything is inconclusive—MQLs are up, ACVs are down, NRR had its worst quarter ever and DAUs have never been higher—and we don’t know how to add it all up.[^5] 

So much of what we build is for the former problem. [Ask](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/ask_data.htm) [any](https://www.thoughtspot.com/product/search) [question](https://www.microstrategy.com/enterprise-analytics/ai-chatbot-for-apps); [drill](https://www.yellowfinbi.com/best-practice-guide/interactions-workflows-and-actions/drill) [into](https://updates.mode.com/more-explorable-reports-with-drill-anywhere-269598) [anything](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/drill-into-data); have an AI agent spelunk through every metric and dashboard, and create a daily digest of the important changes.[^6] Find that one missing clue—that spike in new orders of Bumble Blocks from TikTok—that cracks the case. 

All of this, however, is often counterproductive. More clues don’t help us know what to do; they just create more confusion. Instead, we need help making sense of what we already know. We need help with deduction, not discovery. 

# The elephant in the room

[From Julie Zhao:](https://joulee.medium.com/the-blind-men-the-elephant-and-the-3-data-mistakes-79aaf648c122)

> A famous Indian parable describes five blind men encountering an elephant for the first time. They each decide to touch the elephant to understand what the animal is like.
> “An elephant is smooth and hard, like bone,” says the man who grasped its tusk
> “Nonsense, an elephant is soft like leather,” says the man who felt its ear.
> “You’re both wrong; an elephant is rough like a tree,” says the man who touched its leg.
> The five men begin arguing vehemently, each convinced that he is right. None of them manages to convince the other of anything, except that everyone else is untrustworthy.

Every day, companies are handed a new animal, and have to decide what it is. How would we solve that problem? Probably, [with a process](https://commoncog.com/colin-bryar-amazon-weekly-business-review/): A standard way to poke at the animal and a standard way to evaluate what we learned. 

But most data products are designed with the implicit assumption that we can figure out what the animal is if only we touch just the right corner of if. They’re designed for the paradise of Playful Pines, in which we’re one clever query or one AI-surfaced insight away from discovering that the elephant is an elephant. 

Unfortunately, that’s not where we are, no matter how much we pretend to be living in that [perfect afterlife](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7195786910038982657?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7195786910038982657%2C7195832607660552194%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287195832607660552194%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7195786910038982657%29). And the only way to get to the good place is by designing things for bad place that we’re living in.

[^2]: We [know exactly](https://benn.substack.com/p/its-time-to-build#%C2%A7clique) what PowerStrategy BI does. It brings life to data. It masters your data to accelerate business outcomes. It sets your data free. It unlocks enterprise data for modern analytics. It fuels innovation. It’s data-obsessed. It’s setting the stage for the AI-powered enterprise. It uses analytics for rapid insights to drive informed actions. Data is its rich history. Data is the opportunity. It’s reimagined the future.

# Everything is still BI

*What to expect when you’re not expecting to build a BI tool.*

*It’s hot, but sure, touch it if you want too.*

Look, I get it. You've worked around data for a while, and seen a better way to do things. You worked on a finance team that finally figured out how to do revenue reporting for software-as-a-service businesses. Or you’ve consulted for 50 different ecommerce brands and know the standard set of metrics that everyone needs to measure marketing performance, or you’re a data visualization expert who’s frustrated by how dashboards strip the narrative away from the numbers. Or you’re an analyst on a data team somewhere, and [you’ve built some internal data tool](https://benn.substack.com/p/internal-tools-make-lousy-startups?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=based%20on%20something%20we%20built%20at%20Yammer%20and%20Microsoft) that finally gets right what all the other tools in the market get wrong. 

So you’ll [start a company](https://benn.substack.com/p/a-brief-programming-note?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=On%20August%2026%2C%202013%2C%20along%20with%20two%20other%20cofounders%2C%20I%20signed%20a%20stack%20of%20papers%20to%20officially%20incorporate%20Mode.%20On%20August%2027%2C%20I%20realized%20why%20data%20analysts%20like%20myself%20aren%E2%80%99t%20typically%20among%20the%20first%20employees%20at%20tech%20startups%E2%80%94you%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20much%20to%20do.%C2%A0). You’ll make fundraising decks that tell people that you’ve [been in the trenches](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/everything-is-bi/team.png), and you know that the hard part of working with data isn’t making a chart, but [analytical reasoning](https://mode.com/blog/deliver-analysis-not-charts)—and today’s BI tools don’t solve that problem. 

[But your tool will.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160305130630/https://modeanalytics.com/) You aren’t made for generic business users like the geriatric business intelligence tools of generations past, you might say. We’re something new; something more specialized. An A/B testing tool that finally works; Salesforce reporting that isn’t terrible; [a collaborative data platform](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/everything-is-bi/sales-deck.png). You’ll say you were built for experts; built for sales ops teams; [built for analysts](https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003818/https://modeanalytics.com/); built to [make data scientists more productive](https://web.archive.org/web/20131231172054/http://www.modeanalytics.com/). You’ll say that BI is a broken promise, a gimmick, shelfware; we’re bottoms-up, user-driven, consumer-grade. You’ll say something about turpentine.[^1] 

“Unlike traditional BI products,” you’ll [say in investor pitches](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/everything-is-bi/mode-helps-analysts.png), “we help analysts share high-impact insights with greater speed and flexibility.” People will like the pitch; they’ll buy into your story. “All the other analytics companies that I’ve seen are building dashboards of one sort or another,” [an angel investor might say](https://venturebeat.com/business/welcome-yammer-mafia-modeanalytics-nabs-650k-from-david-sacks-other-yammer-execs/). “There’s definitely a market for that, but they’re doing something different.”

BI is constrained; we are flexible. BI is stale; we are fresh. BI is so irrelevant that you won’t just put BI vendors in a different hemisphere of your [mandatory two-by-two competition grid](https://benn.substack.com/p/metadata-money-corporation?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=You%20need%20a%20two%2Dby%2Dtwo%20matrix%2C%20with%20your%20company%27s%20logo%20in%20the%20upper%20right%2C%20preferably%20larger%20and%20in%20more%20vibrant%20colors%20than%20your%20competitors%E2%80%99%20logos.); you’ll leave most of them [completely off the map](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/everything-is-bi/two-by-two.png). Your real competition, you’ll say, is people not realizing that there’s a better way, [and SAS](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/everything-is-bi/sas.png).[^2]

The market is ready for the revolution, you’ll say. You’ll have a “Why now?” slide in your pitch decks, and it will be filled with facts that only a fool could disagree with. Ten years ago, you might’ve said that data science is going to be the [sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century), that data scientists’ [workflows are broken](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/everything-is-bi/wasting-time.png), and that they need [dedicated, purpose-built tools](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/everything-is-bi/github.png) of their own. You might’ve said that [Redshift would make analytics more accessible](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/future-of-the-modern-data-stack#:~:text=In%20my%20opinion%2C%20the%20modern%20data%20stack%20catalyzed%20around%20the%20release%20of%20Amazon%20Redshift%20in%20October%20of%202012%2C%20and%20hanging%20this%20massive%20painting%20at%20the%20entry%20to%20our%20office%20memorialized%20its%20historic%20importance.). You might’ve said that building a multi-tenant SaaS platform gave us an economic edge over the traditional on-premise vendors. You [might’ve said](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/everything-is-bi/why-now.png) that you’re riding a “strong trend toward ‘democratization of data.’” Today, you might say that analytics engineering is going to be [sexiest job of the 21st century](https://tdwi.org/articles/2022/02/28/ppm-all-analytics-engineers-have-sexiest-job.aspx); that [centralized data platforms like Snowflake](https://benn.substack.com/p/entity-layer?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWorkday%2C%20Salesforce%2C%20Adobe%E2%80%94they%E2%80%99re%20going%20to%20be%20reimplemented%20as%20apps%20on%20top%20of%20the%20data%20layer.%E2%80%9D) will make analytics more accessible; that using AI for development gives you [an economic edge](https://x.com/saranormous/status/1780479005197775102) over traditional software vendors; that you’re riding a strong trend towards [democratization of generative AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmJLYRMwb_Q). There’s a new gold rush, and you’re selling shovels. 

Some people might ask you which Gartner Magic Quadrant™ you’re in. Ridiculous, you’ll say. The old categories were for Qlik, and Spotfire, and [Oracle Business Intelligence Suite Enterprise Edition Plus](https://docs.oracle.com/en/corporate/accessibility/templates/t2-7882.html). We’re something that can’t fit into the categories of yesteryear. [Crazy one today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtftHaK9tYY), category creator tomorrow. In your sales decks, [you’ll cite Gartner’s own research](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/everything-is-bi/worlds-collide.png) to prove your point. 

Your first customers will tell you that you’re right.[^3] Your product “is transforming entirely the way we approach data as a company,” [a head of product will say](https://web.archive.org/web/20150122202315/https://modeanalytics.com/). It “freed up resources to tackle new types of questions,” a vice president of analytics will tell you. You’ll hit milestones. [Hundreds of customers](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/mode-a-collaborative-analytics-platform-focused-on-empowering-data-scientists-just-landed-23-million-in-fresh-funding/#:~:text=Steer%20tells%20us%20600%20organizations%20now%20pay%20for%20Mode); past $1 million in revenue; past $10 million; past the [point of supposed inevitability](https://www.saastr.com/from-initial-traction-to-initial-scale-10m-in-arr-dont-get-killed-by-your-success/). You’ll start hiring more sales reps; someone from another data company will join as your senior director of alliances. You’ll talk about [selling to the enterprise](https://benn.substack.com/p/so-you-want-to-sell-to-the-enterprise).

But—you’ll feel a nagging anxiety. You raised venture money, and venture capitalists want exponential growth. Your growth is more…exponentialish. It was 150 percent two years ago, and 100 percent last year. You’re forecasting 80 percent this year, and that’s assuming [you make up for your slow Q1 in the back half of the year](https://benn.substack.com/i/143485972/revenue). 

You have a plan, though. We can make money from those generic business users. Because your brand is a power tool for power users, [you’ve let the masses use your product for free](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/everything-is-bi/price.png). But it’s been so successful with the specialists they’ve started sharing their work with the rest of the company. They now [make up a majority of your user base](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/everything-is-bi/generic-business-users.png). 

And they’re asking for features. You’ll lose a promising deal at Wayfair because their marketing team preferred Looker. Your most requested feature will become [more visualization types.](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-intergalatic-data-stack?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=A%20few%20years%20into%20building%20Mode%2C%20we%20were%20standing%20on%20a%20growing%20pile%20of%20feature%20requests%20to%20improve%20our%20visualizations.) Then [reports, delivered via email](https://mode.com/blog/share-analysis-via-email#:~:text=Email%20sharing%20was%20one%20of%20the%20most%20popular%20customer%20requests%20and%20we%27re%20excited%20to%20push%20it%20live!). Then [better dashboards](https://mode.com/blog/introducing-layouts#:~:text=Since%20the%20recent%20launch%20of%20multi%2Dquery%20reports%2C%20we%27ve%20seen%20analysts%20share%20reports%20with%20an%20increasing%20number%20of%20charts), and easier ways for people to access data without writing code.

You’ll tell yourself that you can do these things without losing your identity. You’ll be BI, for people who love spreadsheets. You’ll be BI, for Shopify stores. You’ll be BI, reinvented for the age of Slack; for the age of dbt; for the age of the data lakes; for the age of AI. You’ll be notebook-powered BI, or [SQL-powered business intelligence](https://web.archive.org/web/20170603080140/https://modeanalytics.com/). You’ll be an SUV, [with the soul of a sports car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9QJaML9SYw).

Other people, however, won’t see it that way. For prospects, your original brand [will be a chronic condition](https://benn.substack.com/p/clear-eyes-full-hearts?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=The%20banners%20under,and%20die.). They’ll still see you as a spreadsheet, a notebook, a SQL workbench, or a reporting tool for Shopify stores. 

But for customers, the new brand will be a betrayal. They had dozens of BI tools to choose from, they’ll say; we bought you because you were different. [I’m surprised you built that feature request; now we have a renewal to address.](https://genius.com/31595788) 

Internally, you’ll debate what to do. *Are *we a BI tool? Should we embrace it? You’ll ask someone to do a market analysis. Or should we go back to our roots? You’ll never quite decide. You’ll experiment; flirt with the idea; “[maintain optionality](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-best-decision-is-one).” You’ll tell yourself you’re still committed to your original users, but your roadmap will be full of the features that look a lot like PowerBI. Your messaging will change depending on who you’re talking to. Your brand will become some [useless catchphrase](https://benn.substack.com/i/140842906/clique). 

You’ll doubt your past decisions—what if we had never built any BI features at all? What if we just kept building the thing people loved us for in the beginning? What if we [raised less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZgfTarNxdY), and focused on product craft and profitability? 

Ah well, you’ll think. [Maybe next time, you’ll do it differently.](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-saas-counterculture#footnote-anchor-7-144275406:~:text=Build%20something%20that%20you%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20keep%20building%20forever%3B%20sell%20the%20product%20based%20on%20what%20it%20is%20today%20and%20not%20based%20on%20what%20you%20can%20promise%20it%E2%80%99ll%20be%20in%20the%20future.%20If%20MKBHD%20is%20right%2C%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20lot%20of%20appeal%20in%20that%2C%20and%20a%20market%20for%20it%20that%E2%80%99s%20waiting%20to%20be%20sold%20to) But this time, the venture checks have been cashed. The roadmap has been promised. Even though you told yourself you weren’t going to build a BI tool, [that’s where all the money was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa4AlMGF4bE). So you sailed towards the storm, and now, [she’s not going to let you out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Tdw5nG4dQ&t=52s). 

Anyway, last week, Equals, a cloud spreadsheet tool that connects to databases that [we’ve talked about before](https://benn.substack.com/p/ai-is-coming-for-your-favorite-products#%C2%A7bi-is-a-black-hole-part), launched [Equals 24](https://wrap-text.equals.com/p/three-learnings-that-led-to-equals-24). It includes more visualization types, better dashboards, and easier ways for people to access data without writing code. From their [release video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ1QdSQCqUQ):

> We've made a ton of progress towards solving some of the biggest areas of feedback we've received over the years. ... 
> [There is] an all new query builder [that's] particularly powerful for people that don't know SQL. Of course, if you do, Equals supports writing SQL; you can write as complex a query as you'd like. ... We've completely overhauled charts based on your feedback, of which there was a lot. New chart styles, colors, and customization options make it easy to create beautiful charts... [And our dashboards] look better than ever now with those new chart styles, and we have a bunch of design improvements coming very soon, including better-looking tables, layout options and spacers.
> That's Equals 24 in a nutshell. It's still a spreadsheet at its core, but not just a spreadsheet anymore.

What’s striking about this release is that *we said the exact same thing at Mode*. Our core was SQL tools for technical data scientists, and Equals’ core is spreadsheets for finance teams—and both were well inside the event horizon of the BI black hole. Better dashboards, more visualization types, and easier ways to access data were, quite literally, our top feature requests too. 

It’s the gravity that none of us can escape. ThoughtSpot’s [initial ambitions](https://www.thoughtspot.com/press-releases/don%E2%80%99t-bi-just-search-thoughtspot-brings-google-user-experience-business-data) were to “eliminate the need for traditional BI tools through ThoughtSpot Relational Search Engine;” today, it’s [thoroughbred BI](https://res.cloudinary.com/talend/image/upload/w_393/q_auto/qlik/lp/gartner/spot-gartner-magic-quadrant-analytics-and-business-intelligence-platforms_gt44rj.png). Hex, which started as a collaborative notebook for data analysts, built [dashboards and drag-and-drop visualizations](https://hex.tech/blog/hex-three-point-oh/). Transform, which started as a semantic layer, built [dashboards and drag-and-drop visualizations](https://web.archive.org/web/20220929202234/https://blog.transform.co/all/introducing-boards/). Narrator, which started as a data modeling product, built [dashboards and drag-and-drop visualizations](https://www.narratordata.com/product-overview/features/dashboards). And the SQL chatbots are building [dashboards and drag-and-drop visualizations](https://datagpt.com/how-it-works).

In other words, no matter when a data product was created or what its first features were, it will inevitably collapse into the [same singularity](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/anatomy/#singularity): Database connectors; a code-based query editor; a code-free query builder; lots of charts; dashboards; self-serve.

Still, I get it. You’re not convinced. You’ve heard that “everything is BI” before; [it’s](https://benn.substack.com/i/138759555/bi-is-a-black-hole-part) [my](https://benn.substack.com/p/category-collapse#%C2%A7everything-becomes-bi) [whole](https://benn.substack.com/p/we-dont-need-another-sql-chatbot#%C2%A7twenty-pages-of-context-in-a-ten-page-window) [bit](https://benn.substack.com/p/microsoft-builds-the-bomb#footnote-4-123990165).

I’ve been there before too. During one of Mode’s early fundraising blitzes, we were approaching the finish line with a prospective investor. Our sponsoring partner was in favor of doing the deal, and we’d been asked to make a closing pitch at the home of one of the firm’s senior leaders. The partner, a founder of a $50 billion public company with a house in [Sea Cliff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Cliff,_San_Francisco) to match,[^4] was our final boss.

We got destroyed. Within the first half hour, we all knew the deal was dead. The next 90 minutes were polite theater. As we were leaving, we all shook each other’s hands and talked about “next steps,” though everyone knew that there wouldn’t be any. The partner left us with a final bit of advice: We'd never make it without building an in-memory database. We were a BI tool, he said, and BI tools need fast, in-memory compute engines.

On the car ride home, we rolled our eyes at his dumb warning. Ok boomer, you irrelevant fossil. We weren’t a BI tool; we were something new; if he couldn’t see that, we didn’t want his money anyway.[^5] 

And then, six years later, we [rebuilt Mode around an in-memory database](https://mode.com/blog/announcing-helix) and rebranded it as [Modern BI](https://mode.com/blog/introducing-mode-as-modern-bi).

There are a lot of lessons to take away from this story—most of them about hubris, some about technology, and one about never turning down wine from a billionaire’s cellar. The biggest lesson, though, is that it's actually very easy to [think different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different), but it’s very hard to *stay* different. 

When people talk about Silicon Valley’s icons—people like Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Sam Altman—they tend to describe them as visionaries. They built huge companies and personal fortunes because they saw something the rest of us didn’t, and were smart enough to figure out how to build it. I’m not an NBA star because I don’t have Russell Westbrook’s [nuclear athleticism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdkA9UNLcrQ) or Victor Wembeyamba’s [alien proportions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgTqkEkNJrE). I’m not buying Hawaii because I don’t have Mark Zuckerberg’s big brain.

But in truth, that’s probably a cope. These people are successful for a far more accessible reason: They’re stubborn. Most of their ideas weren’t all that [new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace) or [profound](https://www.cnet.com/culture/tesla-motors-founders-now-there-are-five/). Instead, they were uniquely insistent on what they wanted to build, and uniquely unrelenting in building that thing. Steve Jobs didn't care what [customers](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10558091-it-s-really-hard-to-design-products-by-focus-groups-a) thought; Jeff Bezos didn't care what his [employees](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611#:~:text=Ha%2C%20ha!%20You%20150%2Dodd%20ex%2DAmazon%20folks%20here%20will%20of%20course%20realize%20immediately%20that%20%237%20was%20a%20little%20joke%20I%20threw%20in%2C%20because%20Bezos%20most%20definitely%20does%20not%20give%20a%20shit%20about%20your%20day.) thought; Elon Musk didn’t care what the [U.S. Security and Exchange Commission](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776) thought; Sam Altman didn’t care what [Scarlett Johansson](https://x.com/sama/status/1790075827666796666) thought.[^6] It is not having a vision that gets you labeled as a visionary; it’s refusing to let it go. And that’s something any of us *could* do, but very few of us actually do.

Similarly, you could build something that’s not BI, but you won’t do it by being clever. You’ll do it by being stubborn. Customers will demand dashboard and drag-and-drop visualizations. Your market analysis will say that’s where the opportunity is. Your financial models will look better when you can sell to generic business users. Bit by bit, building a BI tool will become the “smart” choice. If you want to be different, it takes will, not wits.

# The rise of the analytics pretendgineer

*How to fix dbt. Plus, everything is spreadsheets, and Snowflake is bullish on B2B SaaS.*

*[basically](https://benn.substack.com/p/should-we-be-nice-to-chatgpt?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=I%20told%20it%20to%20write%20a%20Javascript%20function%20that%20would%20print%20the%20first%20five%20odd%20prime%20numbers.%20One%20time%2C%20this%20was%20the%20entirety%20of%20its%20response%3A)*

One way to think about a dbt model is that it’s a table. It’s easy to think this, because most dbt models do, literally, create tables in a database. A company might have a `products` table that’s imported from their inventory management system, a `charges` table that’s imported from their Stripe account, and a dbt model called `orders` that combines the two into a table that contains details about anything anyone ever bought from the company. That dbt model will be a SQL query; the output of the SQL query will be a table. 

But another way to think about a dbt model is that it’s a *function*. The data team is trying to create something—in this case, a list of everything the company has ever sold—and the orders model takes two tables as inputs and produces a new table as its output. The model is a formula that contains a bunch of computational logic that describes how to do that calculation.

A dbt project, then, is roughly analogous to a program. Each model is a function. The functions can reference one another. And the functions’ authors layer them on top of each other, with the goal of producing a collection of tables[^1] that people can use to build dashboards and answer questions. 

Of course, dbt Labs didn’t invent this sort of data modeling “program.” Prior to dbt, data teams used other tools to manufacture the datasets that people used to build reports and do analysis. But, the previous versions of these programs were hard to write. They were written in languages that are less accessible than SQL; they ran against databases that were relatively slow and relatively easy to break; the production datasets were sometimes [complex and confusing](https://benn.substack.com/p/ghosts-in-the-data-stack) objects like OLAP cubes. To create the `orders` tables in an [Oracle Database 10](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/database10g-doc.html)*[g](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/database10g-doc.html)* in 2004, you had to design a table was legible to Oracle’s BI tool, [write your own](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B14117_01/server.101/b10759/statements_1001.htm) `CREATE` statements that produce that table, hand-code things like [transaction blocks](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/cncpt/transactions.html) to make sure your script doesn’t [nuke the entire database](https://itnext.io/what-we-learned-after-i-deleted-the-main-production-database-by-mistake-13c0a5815de5) or send it spiraling [into some infinite loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/18rluq/paul_graham_creates_a_loop_in_the_database_hacker/), index your new table correctly, figure out somewhere to deploy the script, and then monitor the whole thing to make sure that a missing [shrink operation](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B14117_01/server.101/b10742/storage.htm#sthref308) doesn’t grind your 10*g* into useless brick. And if you had lots of models that used your orders table as an input, you had to figure out how to make sure they always run at the right times, in the right order.

It was hard. It took time to learn how to do it. [One does not simply walk into orders](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/one-does-not-simply-walk-into-mordor) tables; they take the [Oracle 2 Day DBA](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B14117_01/server.101/b10742/toc.htm) course first. 

The people who took those sorts of courses, however, didn’t just learn technical skills. They also learned about the art of data modeling. They learned how to organize and arrange the various functions in their “program” so that they’d be easy to update. They learned how to design efficient functions that wouldn’t crash the database. They learned how to [structure the final datasets](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/A97630_01/server.920/a96520/schemas.htm) that they produced so that they would be easy to use. It wasn’t perfect, by any means, but there was a sense of rigor to the entire exercise. People wrote “[definitive guides](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Warehouse-Toolkit-Definitive-Dimensional/dp/1118530802)” about it.

dbt changed all this—mostly for the better, but a bit for the worse. People could construct data models in pure SQL; they didn’t need to worry about things like transaction blocks or table indexes or DDL; dbt handled the dependency graph between models and made sure everything always ran in order. Moreover, modern databases made everything much more durable—whereas an inefficient model might knock down an old Teradata warehouse or Hadoop cluster, products like Redshift and Snowflake could absorb it. 

On one hand, fantastic. People can now write data modeling “programs” without the headaches of yesteryear. It’s cheaper, faster, and far less tedious. A hard thing became an easy thing.

On the other hand, though dbt made data modeling easy, it didn’t make it *simple*.[^2] The goal of the data modeling “program” is still more or less the same today as it was twenty years ago: Bring the meaning of data close to its surface. Transforming some hideous log of web events and mangled Salesforce opportunity records into a useful table that tallies how many active users are in every account is computationally convoluted. There are a lot of logical steps required to write those formulae. While dbt makes it much easier to write each one—each model is just a query, saved in a SQL file—it doesn’t really tell you how to bind them all together. Should you write one query that does it all? Six queries, each with some isolated bit of logic? Six queries, with each referencing a [dbt macro](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros)? One choice will make the data modeling “program” efficient and tidy; the other will turn it into a sprawling briar patch of tangled dependencies and tech debt. One will simplify; the other will [complect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4&t=1897s). 

I have no idea which one is which though, partly because this is a toy problem and all made up, and partly because I—like the vast majority of dbt’s other users—were never taught how to write the program. We only learned how to write functions*.*

## Benngineering

For a time, every time someone sent a support request into Mode, the customer success manager who owned the account submitting the ticket would get a message on Slack telling them about it.[^3] I wrote the code that powered the system. A webhook from Intercom triggered a script in AWS Lambda; that script went back to the Intercom API to retrieve more details about the ticket and called the Salesforce API to get information about the account that the ticket belonged to. A hard-coded if statement inside of the Lambda mapped Mode account reps to their Slack handles. Another function composed a Slack message that mentioned the rep and attached a link to the ticket. A final function sent the message to Slack’s API. 

It “worked.” Slack messages got posted for most support tickets, and most messages mentioned the right rep. But, when an actual engineer—as opposed to me, a pretengineer, a benngineer—opened up the code to make an update, they were horrified. The entire “application” was a disorganized series of Python functions that had been haphazardly glued together into a Rube Goldberg machine of namespace collisions and intertwined logic. 

I wrote it like this because I understand how to write functions, but I don’t know anything about programming frameworks. Proper Python apps are full of stuff like classes and modules and something called `__main__`; I do not know what any of it means. All I knew was how to jam a bunch of functions together—functions that took way too many inputs, because I didn’t know any other way to pass information from one layer of the program to the next. It was brute-force as software engineering ([BASE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)).

—

Every time someone goes to [www.benn.website](https://www.benn.website/), a Python application serves them a webpage. I wrote that application too. It’s a little better than the support Slackbot, but not because I became a better programmer; it’s better because I used Django to build it. Like Ruby on Rails and other web application frameworks, Django both helps you build stuff with Python *and* is very opinionated in its assistance. You are supposed to put certain parts of your program in specific places, and the app often won’t work if you do it differently. Because of this, benn.website is essentially a script, just like the Mode slackbot, but it’s a script with structure. And whenever I wanted to add something new—for example, “how can I use a single variable to control the primary font on my site?”—the internet (or ChatGPT) won’t just give me the code to do it; it’ll also tell me how to organize it. 

Roughly, dbt is functions without a framework. There are [official best practices](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices), but they’re more suggestions than guardrails—and nobody wants to read the manual anyway. As a dbt project grows, the only thing keeping us from turning it into a spidering web of entangled models and duplicative logic is our own discipline and design sense. Which takes skills many of us never learned, because we never *needed* to.[^4]

In other words, dbt’s explosive popularity turned a generation of data analysts into analytics *pretendgineers*. We all figured out ways to create lots of dbt models and glue them all together—dbt is very good at this, it’s very useful, and people are very creative!—but most teams did it in the same way I built the Slackbot: As fragile scripts, full of imaginative workarounds that are a little too creative for their own good. It all works, but man, there’s got to be a better way. 

## Everything in Alteryx

From this blog, [last September](https://benn.substack.com/i/136852343/die-a-hero-or-live-long-enough-to-become-alteryx):

> There are, I believe, four well-defined categories in the data world. The first three are reasonably well understood: Warehouses, for storing the numbers; BI platforms, for graphing the numbers; and integration tools, for going out and getting the numbers. 
> The fourth category is basically “other.” It’s a giant pileup of somewhat related functions, like data cataloging, governance, lineage, observability, orchestration, transformation, and discovery. 

From dbt Labs, [two weeks ago](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/our-biggest-launch-event-yet):

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CkyJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4d20adc-5eee-4324-81cc-38d13e835436_1456x650.png)

As a business decision, sure. dbt Labs was either going to die a hero or become Alteryx;[^5] one of those is better for dbt Labs than the other. 

But these additions don’t really address the lingering problem in dbt’s core: That none of us *really* know what we’re doing. That we all improvise a bit too much. That the data modeling program that dbt Labs’ new features will orchestrate, observe, and catalog has been poorly architected, by us, and we don’t know how to fix it.[^6] 

Online tutorials, two-day courses, and O’Reilly books won’t teach us how to do it, nor will hand-wringing about the kids these days change today’s kids. Behaviors are shaped by our environment and [what that environment lets us do](https://benn.substack.com/i/91044568/tools-eat-process-for-breakfast), not the other way around. So long as the big box at the bottom of Slack posts a new message and not a reply, people won’t consistently use threads. If Tesla’s Autopilot Mode lets people zone out when they drive, they won’t be fully attentive drivers, [no matter what the warning label says](https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot#:~:text=Do%20I%20still%20need%20to%20pay%20attention%20while%20using%20Autopilot%3F). And if our data modeling programs are going to be efficient and durable, they need to yell at us when we try to write something different. 

[dbt Mesh](https://www.getdbt.com/product/dbt-mesh) could be a start, though it’s more of a set of organizational capabilities than opinions. My suspicion is that dbt needs the latter, and it needs something that aggressively imposes those opinions on its users. It needs dbt on Rails: A framework that builds a project’s scaffolding, and tells us how to expand it—and not through education, but through functional requirements. Show where to put which bits of logic. Prevent me from doing circular things. Blare warnings at me when I use macros incorrectly. Force me to rigorously define “[production](https://benn.substack.com/p/what-is-production).” 

When I was stumbling my way through building a Django app, I constantly had questions about how to add new things to it, and I had no idea how to fit them into Django’s conventions. Because it’s 2024, I asked ChatGPT for help: “I have a Django app. I want to create a new page where I push a button that fetches data from an external API and displays it on a page. Can you outline how to do this?” 

It responds with two things: Sample code, and an outline of how to arrange that code within Django’s organizational framework. The second thing, I found, is actually more useful than the first, because it’s what kept me from turning my app into my Slackbot script. It’s what makes development scalable.

That’s what I want for dbt—either built into dbt Labs, or on top of it, like Django is on Python. I want to ask how I can create a bunch of new financial reporting datasets, and not just be recommended some SQL queries full of commingled logic; I want to be told how to organize all of it too. I want a framework for writing functions on top of my factory for manufacturing tables.[^7] 

# Everything is BI

[We talked last week](https://benn.substack.com/p/everything-is-still-bi) about Equals, the cloud spreadsheet app that now supports writing SQL. Well. Three weeks ago, as part of their [Spring 2024 Product Launch](https://www.sigmacomputing.com/blog/product-launch-2024-spring), Sigma—a cloud analytics platform [that uses a familiar spreadsheet interface](https://www.sigmacomputing.com/product#:~:text=Sigma%20is%20a,data%20in%20realtime.) to give business users instant access to explore and get insights from their cloud data warehouse—released a "collaborative environment that makes advanced data science approachable to the business with Python support and a refined SQL experience." Two days ago, as part of their [2024 Spring Release](https://hex.tech/blog/spring-release-2024), Hex—a collaborative environment for advanced data analysis that [combines Python support and a refined SQL experience](https://hex.tech/product/notebooks/)—released a spreadsheet interface and no-code data browsing, which “opens up Hex to a whole new universe of people" by giving business users instant access to explore and get insights from their cloud data warehouse. 

We are all born with dreams of being different. We have a special collection of features; a new idea; hope. But customer by customer, contract by negotiated contract, we auction ourselves off to the highest bidder. We amputate our extremities first—a small compromise, here and there, for the greater good. Is it not worth selling a kidney to keep ourselves alive? The [money is merely a means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried) to advance the mission.

But then we replace a limb, or two, until we finally come for the heart—spreadsheets for notebooks; notebooks for spreadsheets; SQL for analysts; drag-and-drop data visualizations for everyone; whatever you need, just sign the contract. Our bodies, [Theseused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus); our souls, bankrupted, [gradually, then suddenly](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/102579-how-did-you-go-bankrupt-two-ways-gradually-then-suddenly), when we reanimate ourselves under some tagline—the complete cloud solution for business analytics; human-powered AI; the enterprise intelligence suite—as hideously conjoined as the Frankenstein that lurches out of our development laboratory and into some astroturfed Product Hunt post. Meet our new monster, [same as the old monster](https://youtu.be/zYMD_W_r3Fg?si=CSkNRGOGVDbWycuR&t=471).

We were promised a second coming. We *promised *a second coming. [There were so many companies](https://www.moderndatastack.xyz/companies/business-intelligence-bi); so many ideas; so many possible revolutions and reinventions. Surely some revelation was at hand. But no. You can outrun death, but you cannot outrun the devil. [The beast approaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkZYbOH0ujw), and stalking us [into oblivion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzNzgsAE4F0). We stay different and die, or we survive, dissected and recomposed into an integrated end-to-end analytics workflow. 

# Favorites

There was also an addendum to Hex’s fundraising announcement: They [raised more money](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/snowflake-ventures-increases-investment-in-hex/) from Snowflake Ventures. Two weeks before that, Sigma [announced the same thing](https://www.sigmacomputing.com/announcements/sigma-raises-200-million-in-series-d-funding). And sandwiched in between the two, Omni, yet another BI tool, said that they [also raised money](https://omni.co/blog/snowflake-invests-in-omni) from Snowflake Ventures. 

Sigma and Hex were both already in Snowflake’s portfolio, and the latest investment in Hex wasn’t (at least publicly) part of a bigger round led by other investors. So these deals aren’t about incubating an ecosystem of promising startups, but, it seems, about Snowflake buying their way onto bigger partners’ roadmaps and boxing out competitors from doing the same. I’ve said before that consolidation doesn’t have to come from outright acquisitions,[^8] but can come from [quid pro quo alliances](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-conglomerate#:~:text=Or%20do%20they%20emerge%20organically%2C%20starting%20with%20vendors%20forming%20exclusive%20partnerships%2C%20and%20the%20industry%E2%80%99s%20informal%20neutrality%20doctrine%20getting%20replaced%20by%20quid%20pro%20quo%20alliances%3F). That seems like Snowflake’s approach here: In exchange for money and the Snowflake sales team selling Hex and Sigma, the two companies will prioritize building a [Snowflake Native App](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/workloads/applications/native-apps/) over a [Databricks Lakehouse App](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-lakehouse-apps), or integrate more directly with [Snowpark Container Services](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview), or *won’t* build anything that might dramatically lower how much a customer uses Snowflake. There’s a lot of value as being seen as star around which everyone else resolves, and Snowflake appears intent on keeping other companies in their orbit.

Or who knows, maybe now is just [a really good time to invest in software](https://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/clouded-judgement-53124-software).

[^1]: And now, [a queryable semantic layer](https://www.getdbt.com/product/semantic-layer).

[^2]: From Rich Hickey’s [famous talk on this subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4&t=105s), simple means the opposite of complex. A straight line is simple; a cursive H is complex. These are *objective* descriptions. Easy things, by contrast, are near to our abilities. [For John Hancock](https://www.tiktok.com/@octopusslover8/video/7203943036634795310), writing a cursive H was probably easy. It’s a *relative* description: What is easy for one person might be difficult for another.

[^3]: SaaS businesses typically hire customer success managers, or CSMs, to make sure customers get what they need from a product, and to sell them new products when they come up for renewal. Being aware of when a customer submitted a feature request or had a technical issue helped CSMs do both.

[^4]: Photography is a useful analogy here. Back in the day of analog film, people who took a lot of pictures tended to also learn more about the craft of photography. They didn’t have to—the only actual barrier to taking pictures was knowing how to work the camera—but the two got bound together. Why go to the effort of teaching yourself how to use a complex camera and spend money on expensive film if you were going to take bad pictures with it? Now, the technical parts of photography are much simpler. “Film” is effectively free. That makes photography much more forgiving, but it also means that a lot of people who don’t know anything about how to take good pictures are going to start taking a lot more of them.

[^5]: I mean, [it’s](https://roundup.getdbt.com/i/144751042/code-vs-low-code-why-not-both) right [there](https://www.alteryx.com/products/designer-cloud).

[^6]: dbt’s newer competitors don’t solve this problem either. SQLMesh, for example, is mostly dbt with better developer ergonomics. That’s useful, and might sell well—we all like ergonomic things—but it sidesteps the core issue: How do we become good designers of the thing we’re building?

[^7]: People, including dbt, tend to measure dbt projects by how many models they have. Which I get; models are the most prominent object in dbt, and are an obvious thing to count. However, that frames dbt in the wrong way. By emphasizing models, we implicitly define dbt as a tool for creating tables. I think it’s more useful to frame dbt as program to create data assets, and dbt models as functions—and we would never count the number of functions in programs. But if we measure in tables, we think in tables.

[^8]: Notably, Snowflake has a bit of a history of [trying](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-22/snowflake-talks-to-acquire-reka-ai-said-to-fizzle-with-no-deal) to [acquire](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/snowflake-to-acquire-samooha/) companies [it](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/snowflake-invests-samooha/) invests [in](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/snowflake-invests-in-reka-further-expanding-llm-capabilities-in-data-cloud/), and the timing of the three announcements, a few days before Snowflake’s annual conference, is at least a little suspicious, if not of an impending acquisition but potentially of some other big show of professional friendship.

# The vibes are weird

*The fraying physics of Silicon Valley. Plus, a false fake from Drake?*

![Interstellar - MEGA Waves Scene](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CqSP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b9b8d2f-82de-4606-a376-6fe1228044a8_1280x720.jpeg)
*[This is not the ocean we’re used to.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IX3G7GP4z4)*

In 2012, it was a party. When I moved to Silicon Valley that year, it was no longer a place for nerdy rebels or idealistic misfits, but a place to get rich without feeling guilty about it. After the financial crisis, a generation of country club brats had started questioning if [working at McKinsey](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2011/09/30/even-artichokes-have-doubts/) really was the most prestigious thing that they could do after graduating from Duke, and tech offered a promising alternative. The Nasdaq was on a [steady march upwards](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1ou8h) from its lows in 2009; huge tech [IPOs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303448404577409923406193162) were [back](https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-shares-trade-higher-in-ipo-1411142120); huge tech [acquisitions](https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/04/09/facebook-buys-instagram-for-1-billion/) were [back](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304914204579393452029288302); Google paid as well as Morgan Stanley, gave you unlimited time off, and didn’t make you [work until 8 p.m. if you wanted to eat dinner for free](https://www.fastcompany.com/1822449/how-wall-street-bankers-use-seamless-feast-on%C2%A0free-lobster-steak-and-beer). Back then, you could have it all: Money and status and time off, [without being evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil), without tucking your shirt in, and without having to leave the office for a couple (dozen) beers. 

Of course, the whole thing had an ugly underbelly—but the perpetrators of that era’s corporate culture weren't worried about that yet. The prevailing sentiment in most tech offices was optimism.[^1] And not for some promising future that we were building, but for the present. It didn’t matter that the old cliché about tech making the world a better place [was already a joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8C5sjjhsso), because for much of Silicon Valley, the world was a pretty good place as it was. 

In 2014, the frat house got raided. The problems in tech’s basement [became headlines](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html) in the *New York Times*. Three-character ASCII art and “locker room talk” stopped getting laughs at hack days, and started getting people fired.[^2] The working environment inside Github—which, back then, was the pantheon of tech culture; [Mecca](https://www.wired.com/story/github-tech-values/); it was every startup’s favorite startup—[got its CEO fired](https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/github-founder-resigns-after-investigation/). Susan Fowler had a [very, very strange year at Uber](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber). It was time to grow up.

Moreover, there weren’t just issues with *how* tech built what it built; what we were building was starting to look problematic too. Taylor Swift [went to war](https://www.stereogum.com/1810310/read-taylor-swifts-open-letter-to-apple-music/news/) against Apple. Amazon [no longer](https://www.vox.com/2017/11/9/16629412/amazon-warehouse-worker-killed-deaths-osha-fines-penalties) felt like the ethical alternative [to Walmart](https://www.amazon.com/Wal-Mart-Effect-Powerful-Works-Transforming/dp/0143038788). Trump won, and people began to wonder if Facebook had something to do with it. 

Still, the core promise held: It was prestigious work that paid well. In some ways, the minor reckoning was a good thing for the brand—it was sign of progress, a needed policing of a few bad apples. People began to talk more openly about tech's problems, but few people seemed to entertain working anywhere else. 

Then, the party was back. A paper by some [anonymous libertarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) got popular. We were promised digital gold, a self-enforcing legal system, freedom from the tyranny of Janet Yellen, a better way to buy drugs, a way to get rich quick. Nobody quite knew what any of it was for, but a16z [liked the idea](https://a16z.com/introducing-a16z-crypto/). A few people got rich; most people got scammed; [the two were related](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/09/technology/three-arrows-cryto-bali.html). 

In 2020, a pandemic, and a flash crash—the Nasdaq [fell by 31 percent](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1oBJJ) in 33 days, a handful of startups evaporated, and the market was back to setting all-time highs less than 80 days later. Everyone started working out of their bedrooms, [got cabin fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuGGCMzSlY), and [lost their minds](https://benn.substack.com/p/does-venture-capital-ruin-great-products?utm_source=publication-search#footnote-anchor-3-137729402:~:text=For%20eighteen%20months%2C%20diligence%20went%20to%20zero%2C%20valuations%20went%20to%20infinity%2C%20and%20a%20bunch%20of%20crossover%20funds%20started%20cannoning%20money%20at%20every%20data%20startup%20they%20could%20find). Venture capitalists unloaded cannons of money as if there was no tomorrow. You could raise a seed round with a pitch deck and a pulse; every series A was "20 on 100;"[^3] every series B was done by [John Curtius](https://www.forbes.com/profile/john-curtius/?sh=2c06460c62cd).[^4] “It’s [one ETL tool](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-series-everything-is-fine?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=Nobody%20played%20this%20game%20better%20than%20Airbyte.), Michael, [what could it cost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl_Qyk9DSUw)? 1.5 billion dollars?” We were up to our elbows in [punch](https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/blog/2016/03/martins-punch-bowl-metaphor/). 

The bowl got [yanked away again](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS); a bank [blew up](https://www.wsj.com/articles/svb-financial-pulls-capital-raise-explores-alternatives-including-possible-sale-sources-say-11de7522); venture capitalists [lectured everyone](https://a16z.com/a-framework-for-navigating-down-markets/) about spending as if there was no tomorrow. It was time it sharpen our pencils, and tighten our belts, and trim our fats. 

But through it all—and even then, in 2022, in the midst of another barrage of layoffs and fire sales—nothing felt fatal. We’d all seen this before; there were no doubts that the sun [would rise again tomorrow](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1d0lqes/highlight_theres_losing_and_then_theres_whats/). We’d get ‘em next year; the boom times would be back; disappointment did not give way to despair. The arena was still a good place to be, and in time, we were destined to be its champions.[^5]

In Silicon Valley, there are two sets of physics. The first is the cyclical patterns of the ocean. There are waves: Some technology will be in vogue; others will be out of fashion. Set sail at the right moment and you can find a crest. Plan your voyage wrong, and you get [stuck in a storm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuzTkGyxkYI).

Work here for a while, though, and you get a feel for the seasons. You can see the waves coming; you figure out how to build a boat that can endure rough waters; you can learn how to [read the sky and forecast the weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfemfUVBv9A&t=81s). Careers in tech aren’t linear, like the slow climb up the corporate ladder at a law firm might be, but they’ve still *predictable—*and often, predictably good. Keep learning how to sail on this ocean, and you’ll eventually find your wave.

Throughout at least the last 12 years, the cycles in Silicon Valley have had this familiar rhythm. There were upbeats and downbeats, but everything stayed in 4/4 time. The debauchery of 2012 had echoes of *Liar’s Poker, *of my cousins’ stories of Silicon Valley in 1999, and of my classmates’ stories about investment banking in 2006. The first crypto boom was weird, but an eccentric appendage of “core tech,” more financial engineering than software engineering. The mainstream stuff, like SaaS and consumer tech, was still an appealing bet for ambitious entrepreneurs. Throughout the pandemic of 2020 and the profligacy of 2021, the waves got bigger, but they retained their essential physics. And during the bad times of 2022, Silicon Valley’s annoited sages [played](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sequoia-warns-founders-of-crucible-moment-advises-how-to-avoid-the-death-spiral) the [usual hits](https://articles.sequoiacap.com/rip-good-times): Hunker down, buckle up, build on, and [trust the process](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/19/yc-advises-founders-to-plan-for-the-worst/).

It was trite, but seemed basically correct? Even if everything collapsed, [the great shroud of the sea](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/835133-t-hen-all-collapsed-and-the-great-shroud-of-the-sea) would roll on as it rolled five thousand startups ago. We would build another boat and sail on, a little bit wiser about how to navigate whatever storms and swells might be coming next. 

But now, man, I don't know.

Because in the last year, the second set of physics in Silicon Valley—the foundational laws of the ocean, of the atmosphere, of what floats and what sinks—seem to be breaking down. 

We have become obsessed with AI. [Fifty percent](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/meet-the-yc-winter-2024-batch) of the startups in Y Combinator are building around it. *[Eighty-five percent](https://insight.factset.com/second-highest-number-of-sp-500-companies-citing-ai-on-earnings-calls-over-past-10-years)* of tech companies in the S&P 500 are talking about it. Companies are rebranding themselves around it. Snowflake is no longer a database, or The Data Cloud, but the AI Data Cloud™. [Asana is](https://asana.com/) the “#1 AI work management platform.”[^6] Intercom is [AI-first](https://www.intercom.com/). No, Zendesk is [AI-first](https://www.zendesk.com/).[^7] We are impaneling conferences about AI; [raising](https://aigrant.com/) venture [funds](https://www.conviction.com/);[^8] starting newsletters; hosting emergency podcasts. This is not an [iPhone moment](https://fortune.com/2023/03/01/artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt-iphone-moment-bank-of-america/) or the [next internet](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-co-founder-bill-gates-chatgpt-will-change-our-world-2023-02-10/), because those [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U) had [naysayers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgODUgHeT5Y). Now, the only debate seems to be about [which side of the AI revolution human beings will be on](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/31/tech/sam-altman-ai-risk-taker/index.html). 

It’s the crypto gold rush all over again, except the winners are [paid in legal tender](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2024/). It’s the crypto gold rush, except the losers won’t just miss out on some money; they’ll get steamrolled into obsolescence. And so we’re all frantically building new features—[60 percent of one VC’s portfolio](https://docsend.com/view/pi629vaxy57u9qvb) is already using generative AI in their product. We’re launching new companies. We’re investing in new startups. We’re turning tech on a dime, all trying to skate where the puck is going. 

On the surface, everyone is confident. What they’re selling, you’ll be buying. In an AI-powered future, [data quality](https://www.montecarlodata.com/) will be even more critical. [Your CRM](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/ai-crm/) will be even more critical. Your [e-signature management platform](https://www.docusign.com/intelligent-agreement-management) will be even more critical. Your [useless blog subscriptions](https://benn.substack.com/) will be even more critical. The future is oh so exciting, we say in public. 

But in private, the vibe is different. Beneath the showy confidence, there’s a shaky unease. Nobody knows where the puck is going. The puck is teleporting. The puck is from another dimension—one in which computers speak English and can’t do math. The puck might get obliterated by GPT-5, and our current standing in the social order might get obliterated with it. We launched the AI features, [but nobody uses them](https://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/clouded-judgement-53124-software#:~:text=AI%20Revenue%20Hasn%E2%80%99t%20Shown%20Up); are we sure we’re made the right bets? Are we sailing on the same ocean, the ocean we’ve spent our careers exploring? Will the the new ocean [be better for someone else](https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/anthropics-chief-of-staff-avital-balwit-ai-remote-work)? Even if we don’t get outright replaced—which I don’t think is behind the creeping anxiety—are we sure the skills we’ve learned and the boats we’ve built for the old tides will still be seaworthy? Are we sure our new startup [is future-proof](https://x.com/saranormous/status/1798860569312981239)? Apple events were fun, a chance to see some cool new gadgets, and to think about ways we could use them. OpenAI events are [the reaping](https://thehungergames.fandom.com/wiki/The_Reaping). We act excited, but deep down, we’re just hoping to survive. 

Is Silicon Valley [back](https://x.com/packyM/status/1798715709532389740), or is Silicon Valley coming unglued? The old foundations are buckling. It’s [the end of software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/103cGe8qixC7ZzFsRu5Ww2VEW5YgH9zQaiaqbBsZ1lcc/edit)—though notes like these don’t feel like just predictions, but self-affirmations, that if we act like we know what’s coming, we can manifest our own continued relevance. Do we build a team to build a business, or just build a team? The best acquisitions are now acquihires—[650 million dollars](https://www.fastcompany.com/91069182/microsoft-inflection-ai-exclusive) for the leadership team of Inflection AI; [1.3 billion dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/26/databricks-picks-up-mosaicml-an-openai-competitor-for-1-3b/) for a bunch of GPUs and a team of AI researchers; [150 million dollars](https://www.supervised.news/p/snowflake-plunges-into-ai-and-openai#:~:text=Neeva%20was%20effectively%20acquihired%20for%20%24150%20million%20earlier%20this%20year%20for%20its%20team%20and%20its%20technology.) for a [new CEO](https://venturebeat.com/ai/snowflake-names-neeva-co-founder-as-ceo-with-focus-on-ai-opportunity/); [1 to 2 billion dollars](https://www.wsj.com/articles/databricks-to-buy-data-management-startup-tabular-in-bid-for-ai-clients-829e5bcf) for the chair of an open-source project. 

In a founder email list I’m on, more people than ever seem to be eschewing venture capital because they want to build a “real” business, or buy a bunch of cleaning companies and become a micro PE firm. Is happiness in Silicon Valley is no longer a traditional startup, but a bootstrapped business and taking fistfuls on longevity pills? Venture capitalists are also preaching fiscal responsibility. It’s the end of easy money; the age of austerity, the [year of efficiency](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/1/23581938/mark-zuckerberg-meta-earnings-q4-efficiency-cutting-managers), a time to [play to make plan](https://kellblog.com/2024/05/26/playing-to-win-vs-playing-to-make-plan-the-two-very-different-worlds-of-silicon-valley/)—but also, some French AI startup you’ve never heard of just [raised 220 million dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/french-ai-startup-h-raises-220-million-seed-round/) *in a seed round*. There are no reliable physics anymore. 

[Get rid of the classic product management](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/brian-cheskys-contrarian-approach), says one founder worth 10 billion dollars. [Get rid of management altogether](https://x.com/StartupArchive_/status/1796147169650761937), says another founder worth ten times that. Elon Musk is [seceding to Austin](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-texas-town-52386513). Founders Fund is [seceding to Miami](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article250258600.html). Politics [is banned](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company); politics has Sand Hill Road’s [usually chummy](https://x.com/shaunmmaguire/status/1115384303951605760) cocktail class [at each other’s throats](https://x.com/shaunmmaguire/status/1720857906952970626). The [2024 election](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/us/politics/trump-sacks-silicon-valley-donors.html) hasn’t even started yet. 

Is it the end of something? Is some era dead? Are we getting [getting eaten](https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/)? Is it [time to build](https://a16z.com/its-time-to-build/)? [I don’t know.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOYi4NzxlhE&t=101s) The ocean is changing too quickly; the weather is too unfamiliar. The moment betrays buzzy headlines and showy predictions. Whatever gets made now will likely be upended two or three times before the sea settles down. The best reason to build a boat today may not be to make something that endures, but simply to be out on the ocean, for whenever it finds its rhythm again. Because the water is convulsing in weird ways, and you don’t fight the sea.

# Drake fakes deep fake?

If you’re a famous rapper and you’re in the middle of a very public rap battle with another famous rapper, you have two choices:

There are your only two choices, and neither are ideal. If you don’t put out a song, people—[including the person you’re battling](https://genius.com/31490657)—might call you a coward. This is bad in a rap battle. You cannot win a rap battle without battling in it.[^9] 

But putting out a song is risky. If people like the song, they’ll [make](https://www.tiktok.com/@banterclubsupporter/video/7365035753228864810) [memes](https://www.tiktok.com/@sleepyghostmp3/video/7366542592852610350) about it and you will score a lot of points. This will be good for you and bad for your opponent. If people *don’t* like the song, however, people will also [make](https://www.reddit.com/r/KendrickLamar/comments/1cl789w/this_video_pretty_much_summarizes_the_heart_part_6/) [memes](https://www.tiktok.com/@dadlifejason/video/7367535851380788523) about it—but they will be bad for you and good for your opponent. Hence the choice, about what to do, if you are in a rap battle: Don’t drop a song and take a guaranteed small loss, or do drop and wait for the internet to decide if you put out a banger or a bomb. 

Ideally, you wouldn’t have to make this choice. Your best option is option three: Record the song and figure out if people like it *before* you drop it. Unfortunately, as a famous rapper, you can’t do this. Nothing would lose a rap battle faster than people finding out that you focus grouped your diss song. And you can’t secretly release the song either—everyone knows what your voice sounds like. 

Anyway, last week, Drake, who was last seen getting humiliated by Kendrick Lamar in a rap battle, dropped a new song on Soundcloud. [Or maybe he didn’t?](https://variety.com/2024/music/news/drake-hey-there-delilah-cover-real-ai-1236024530/)

> Late on Monday, the internet exploded with a version of the Plain White T’s moody 2005 hit sung in Caribbean patois in what *sounds* like Drake‘s voice (but these days, who knows?). The cover, titled “Wah Gwan Delilah” and filled with Toronto references and slang, was uploaded by SoundCloud user Snowd4y and claims to feature Drake.
> The track has more than 200,000 plays on SoundCloud and immediately went viral on Twitter. But is it *real*?

Previously, if you heard [a song](https://soundcloud.com/snowd4y/snowd4y-wah-gwan-delilah-feat-drake) with Drake’s voice, you wouldn’t wonder if it was Drake or not. Now, with AI, we don’t know anymore. It could be Drake; it could be a random woman in a basement with a [Speechify subscription](https://speechify.com/voice-cloning/) and a Soundcloud account. It could be The Weeknd; it could be [ghostwriter997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_on_My_Sleeve_(ghostwriter977_song)). It could be Eminem; it could be [David Guetta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98WTwSnkoas). We used to be able to know if a song was real by listening to it; now, the only way to know it’s real is if person in it tells us that it is.

*But they don’t have to tell the truth. *Drake can make a song, release it under some other account, [promote it without saying if it’s his](https://variety.com/2024/music/news/drake-hey-there-delilah-cover-real-ai-1236024530/#:~:text=Drake%20posted%20a%20screenshot%20of%20the%20song%20on%20his%20Instagram%20story%2C%20which%20would%20seem%20to%20suggest%20that%20it%E2%80%99s%20actually%20him.), and *then decide* if he wants to tell people he made it. The flops can be fun fanfic. The hits can be his. But they’re actually all his.[^10] 

When people talk about the dangers of AI, they often talk about deep fakes, which are AI-generated images and videos that appear real. As bad as these are, they’re only half the problem. We’ll also have to deal with false fakes. People can now—very plausibly!—claim that something that’s real was made by AI. That dud? Not mine. [That embarrassing photo?](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/al-franken-that-photo-and-trusting-the-women/545954/) Adobe [Generative Fill](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/generative-fill.html) and a smear campaign. [That hot mic?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape) I never said that. 

Though “my account got hacked” was always [a suspect excuse](https://www.politico.com/story/2011/05/lewd-photo-was-hack-weiner-says-055877) for doing something dumb online, it was useful because it could plant a seed of unresolvable doubt. Unless someone admitted that they were lying, you could never prove the negative. “That’s AI-generated” could become the same generic defense—never probable, but now, always possible.

*[Look, I’m fired.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM-NcMZhcaA)*

We are, here at [Initech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnPBSy5FsOc), very sorry that your money is gone. We are sorry that the email addresses and credit card numbers you gave us were sold off down by the docks, and that some Russian hackers stole your identity. The security and confidentiality of your data is [our number one priority](https://www.domo.com/platform/security) at Initech, and it is a shame that your information has been compromised. Our team of experts will be happy to assist you in any way we can (provided that you are on our Enterprise or Enterprise+ tier). 

But it is also important to understand that none of this is our fault. Security is [core to our business](https://www.snowflake.com/product/security-and-trust-center/) and [our platform](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/security); it is [built into every layer](https://www.databricks.com/trust) of our product. Our company [runs on trust](https://www.getcensus.com/security), [customer trust](https://www.thoughtspot.com/legal/trust), *your trust*, and we take that responsibility very seriously. Our software is [secure by default](https://segment.com/security/). It is [industry-leading](https://hex.tech/security/), [enterprise-grade](https://slack.com/trust/security), [state-of-the-art](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/trust), [end-to-end](https://legal.hubspot.com/security), [world-class](https://www.anaplan.com/platform/security/). We have many [badges](https://security.sigmacomputing.com/), [certifications](https://www.fivetran.com/security), [accreditations](https://www.qlik.com/us/trust), and [acronyms](https://www.palantir.com/information-security/)—TLS 1.2, AES-256, SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, CCPR, GxP, ITAR, IL5 DoD SRG, etc—that demonstrate how we treat your data as [if it were our data](https://www.getdbt.com/security). 

So look. We did our part. But if you put [50,000 dollars in a shoebox](https://www.thecut.com/article/amazon-scam-call-ftc-arrest-warrants.html) and hand it to a stranger in a black SUV, that is not on us. If you [fell for a phishing email](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/28/13456368/how-john-podesta-email-got-hacked) and sent your Gmail password to [Fancy Bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_Bear#Democratic_National_Committee_(2016)),[^1] you messed up, not us. And if you use [simple passwords](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/12/17/dutch-trump-twitter-password-hack/) and don’t enable multi-factor authentication on your account—which, of course, we strongly recommend that you do—there is only so much we can do to protect you. We make the locks, they are good locks, and we can’t be blamed if you don’t use them properly. 

Because we use *our* locks properly. We have [many reports](https://security.asana.com/) from outside auditors that confirm this. We have a chief security officer; we have an official “[data protection officer](https://www.edps.europa.eu/data-protection/data-protection/reference-library/data-protection-officer-dpo_en).” We maintain a list of 224 [SOC-2 “controls”](https://www.ispartnersllc.com/blog/soc-2-controls)—password policies for our company Slack, code review standards for our engineers, regular security training programs for employees, a Dropcam in our office, and many others—that are carefully tracked and tediously documented.[^2] 

Still, because we are committed to [transparent communication](https://www.workday.com/en-us/why-workday/trust/security.html), we commissioned an independent investigation to figure out how your money was stolen. Third-party cybersecurity experts found no evidence of a breach of Initech, our systems, or our employees. Instead, your money was stolen because of compromised customer credentials; i.e., someone stole your password; i.e., [PEBCAK](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=PEBCAK); i.e., a [skill issue](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/skill-issue-simply-a-difference-in-skill); i.e, you, not us. You gave your debit card and PIN number to a thief; don’t blame the ATM. 

In conclusion, we did our job. It’s a shame that this bad thing happened, and we are unhappy about it and all of that. But the most important thing for you to understand here is that it’s not our fault.

A couple weeks ago, some hackers [stole a bunch of data out of Snowflake](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/mandiant-hackers-snowflake-stole-significant-volume-data-customers/):

> Security researchers say they believe financially motivated cybercriminals have stolen a “significant volume of data” from hundreds of customers hosting their vast banks of data with cloud storage giant Snowflake.
> Incident response firm Mandiant, which is working with Snowflake to investigate the recent spate of data thefts, said in a blog post Monday that the two firms have notified around 165 customers that their data may have been stolen.

Snowflake, as part of their [commitment to transparency](https://community.snowflake.com/s/question/0D5VI00000Emyl00AB/detecting-and-preventing-unauthorized-user-access), hired third-party cybersecurity experts CrowdStrike and Mandiant to investigate the hack; they “have not identified evidence suggesting this activity was caused by a vulnerability, misconfiguration, or breach of Snowflake’s platform” or “by compromised credentials of current or former Snowflake personnel;” they said it *was *caused “[compromised customer credentials](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc5537-snowflake-data-theft-extortion)” that were “exposed through unrelated cyber threat activity;” they [strongly recommend](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-mfa) that all account administrators use multi-factor authentication to protect their accounts. 

In other words, Snowflake says that they did what any reasonable cloud software vendor would be expected to do. And while it is unfortunate that this happened, the important thing to know is that it wasn’t their fault.

—

But was it? Was Snowflake to blame? Their customers? Nobody but the hackers themselves? What exactly are we supposed to make of this whole thing?[^3] 

On one hand, by all accounts, it doesn’t seem like Snowflake did anything capital-W Wrong. They followed the protocols that they were supposed to follow; they built software according to the standards they were supposed to meet; no Snowflake employee stole anything, left a door open, or told somebody something they shouldn’t have.[^4] They were an ATM, and someone stole their customers’ PINs. It *is* hard to blame the ATM for that. 

On the other hand, Snowflake did, in a sense, make the ATM popular. Twenty years ago, most databases lived behind firewalls and were only available via VPNs or from approved IP addresses. Corporate data was, almost literally, in a locked vault that you had to physically break into to steal. Today, in part because of Snowflake’s success and its own efforts [marketing the benefits of the cloud](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/true-value-data-storage-continues-emerge/), people can log into their databases like they would any other website, through [a publicly-accessible web page](https://facebook.snowflakecomputing.com/console/login#/),[^5] with a username and password. Snowflake also helped popularize using basic authentication methods like usernames and passwords as the [modern](https://fivetran.com/docs/destinations/snowflake/setup-guide#:~:text=Enter%20the%20User%20and%20Database%20names%20you%20found%20in%20Step%202.) [standard](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/connect-to-snowflake#connect-to-snowflake-with-basic-authentication) [by](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/connections-snowflake-add) [which](https://docs.getmontecarlo.com/docs/snowflake#providing-service-account-credentials-during-onboarding) [data](https://hightouch.com/docs/sources/snowflake#provide-credentials) [products](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/available-sources/snowflake#configuring-a-new-snowflake-connection) [connect](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/connect-to-data/data-connections/data-connections-introduction#:~:text=Example%20Data%20Connection) [to](https://mode.com/help/articles/connecting-mode-to-your-database) [databases](https://docs.omni.co/docs/connections/database/snowflake/#create-snowflake-connection). 

In essence, Snowflake and other cloud warehouse vendors moved data out of the firewalled vaults, and into ATMs all over the internet. That’s a design pattern that is fundamentally more vulnerable to certain types of hacks than the prior version.[^6] Accordingly, [most criticisms of Snowflake](https://securityboulevard.com/2024/06/snowflake-ticketmaster-richixbw/) aren’t just about Snowflake, but about problems inherent in SaaS software: That simple single-factor authentication is simple to hack. When money is in a bank, you have to rob the bank to get it out. When money is an ATM, you just need to steal some debit cards and phish for people’s PINs.[^7] 

But! It’s also a design pattern that we like! ATMs *are* convenient. Multi-factor authentication *[is](https://www.tiktok.com/@tonystatovci/video/7325948278833515819)*[ annoying](https://www.tiktok.com/@tonystatovci/video/7325948278833515819). The convenience of the cloud and putting everything on the internet is the world we asked for—and so, it’s a world that Snowflake can give us, without violating any generally accepted accessibility protocols. In 2000, had a company built a database that you could log into from a website and with the password “[password](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/arts/sony-hack-computer-passwords-included-871680/),” we would probably blame that company if its customers’ accounts got hacked. Now, eh—we may not exonerate the company completely, but we put a lot of the blame on the customers themselves. 

That’s the thing about data breaches, and about the entire software security industrial complex: It’s not about security; it’s about *blame*. 

Most companies don’t get have lengthy security pages and pay for tedious compliance reports because they believe that jumping through a bunch of bureaucratic hoops, like logging when every employee was added or removed from Asana, will make anything meaningfully more secure; they jump through those hoops and get those reports so that, if something does go wrong, they can say that it’s not their fault.[^8] The probability that companies want to minimize is not the probability of a hack; they want to minimize the probability *that they get blamed for a hack*.[^9] Compliance standards aren’t about security; compliance standards are about liability.[^10] And in the two-decade long transition to the cloud, we’ve come to shift the liability for things like [bad password policies](https://www.wired.com/2008/09/palin-e-mail-ha/#:~:text=Instead%2C%20the%20hacker%20simply%20reset%20Palin%27s%20password%20using%20her%20birthdate%2C%20ZIP%20code%20and%20information%20about%20where%20she%20met%20her%20spouse%20%2D%2D%20the%20security%20question%20on%20her%20Yahoo%20account%2C%20which%20was%20answered%20(Wasilla%20High)%20by%20a%20simple%20Google%20search.) onto the users and not the vendors. 

That’s the bet Snowflake made in making things like multi-factor authentication optional—that they ultimately wouldn’t be blamed for a hack like this. As the story escalated,[^11] they’ve added the reverse [Streisand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect): Turn a mountain into a molehill by largely [doing as little press as possible](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/07/snowflake-ticketmaster-lendingtree-customer-data-breach/),[^12] and hope the whole thing blows over. Which probably isn’t a bad strategy, at least for the time being. If the important thing is for people not to think that it’s your fault—and in cloud software security, that is and [always has been](https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Always-Has-Been.png) the important thing—you can’t get blamed for something that nobody’s talking about. 

# Blame, again

There’s also a broader point here. The entire corporate cybersecurity apparatus is designed to preemptively make the case that whatever went wrong isn’t our fault. But we don’t just do that with security policies. We pre-build this argument—that the important thing for you to know is that it’s not my fault—all the time, and are as frequently motivated by it as we are whatever problem we’re ostensibly trying to solve.

For example, when a controversial decision is being made, people will often softly object. They won’t want to *change* the decision, because then, if something bad happens, it *will* be their fault. Instead, they will just want to object “for the record”—a record that will likely get forgotten if things go well, but they’ll definitely remember if things go poorly.

For example, when an investor invests in a startup, they will sometimes push CEOs to make certain decisions. They will nudge, cajole, and coerce—but almost never outright instruct. Because they aren’t here to make decisions; they’re here to advise and support. If that advice works out, great, they’re adding value. And if it doesn’t, well, that’s not their fault. The CEO makes the decisions.

For example, when an executive asks a data team for some sort of analysis, they’re asking for counsel, but they’re also often asking for a contingency. [If the decision goes well](https://benn.substack.com/p/does-data-make-us-cowards?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=Later%2C%20if%20the%20decision%20works%20out%2C%20you%20can%20claim%20credit%20for%20your%20cleverness.%20If%20it%20doesn%E2%80%99t%2C%20you%20can%20say%20you%20just%20did%20what%20any%20reasonable%20person%20would%E2%80%99ve%20done.), “you can claim credit for your cleverness. If it doesn’t, you can say you just did what any reasonable person would’ve done,” and listened to the data. I played the numbers, and it’s not my fault that we got unlucky. 

Everyone will say that the important thing is [winning as a team](https://x.com/JrueUTD/status/1801385572667187476). And in good times, sure, it is. But people are always looking for ways to buy themselves an insurance policy, because [in bad times](https://x.com/RKalland/status/1801111463639011610), the important thing for you to understand [is that it isn’t my fault](https://x.com/YouWager_FF/status/1801234394788614295). 

# Cloud security, again

When stories like the one about Snowflake come out, the first reaction is usually to point fingers. The second is bewilderment: How could they let this happen? How could they have been so unusually careless?

Which, oh man, if only. Every tech company presents themselves like Initech, as very serious experts who build bleeding-edge security programs with militaristic discipline. And maybe a few do. But most tech companies [are FTX](https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-ftx-multimillion-dollar-expenses-were-approved-by-emoji-fb91bb3a): Full of loose access controls, everything passed around Slack, held together [by Scotch tape and bubble gum](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/technology/prevent-cyberattack-linux.html).

Back sometime before the pandemic, the team at Mode used a popular product—let's call it [PodesData](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Podesta#Personal_email_leak)—that connected directly to Snowflake, which we were using as our primary data warehouse. PodesData had to interact with our data, and was was authorized to do it in the same way as just about every other tool that connects to Snowflake: We created a new Snowflake user called something like THIRD_PARTY_PODESDATA, granted that user access to the data is that PodesData needed to see, and provided that users’s password to PodesData, via some web form inside of their application. 

A few months later, we had some mundane technical issue that we needed help fixing. We emailed their support team, and an agent started investigating different things that might’ve gone wrong. At some point during the conversation, the agent emailed us a screenshot of what they were seeing “on their side.” The screenshot was of a query the agent had written, directly against our Snowflake database, from [inside the Snowflake console](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-worksheet). 

We lost our minds. Because the existence of this screenshot meant three things:

We threw a tantrum, canceled our contract on the spot, and migrated to a competitor within a few days. But, while this was bad, it wasn't exactly *surprising*. If you work around startups for a while—or for a few weeks, really—you’ll see dozens of these stories. Of data being passed around encrypted thumb drives. Of passwords accidentally posted in public Github repos. Of unsecured laptops being left at coffee shops. Of every employee having access to production databases that, as we were told by PodesData, they are instructed but technically not required to get permission to use. 

Every SaaS company has carefully-worded security policies that are written by lawyers. And then they have lived security policies, which are usually “most people don’t know how to write SQL, so it’s probably fine.” 

# Attention numbers

I mean, [it was](https://www.wsj.com/articles/databricks-to-buy-data-management-startup-tabular-in-bid-for-ai-clients-829e5bcf) an acquihire, right?

For the second year in a row, Databricks announced a billion-dollar acquisition on the first day of their biggest rival’s annual conference.[^13] In 2023, Databricks acquired MosaicML, then a two-year old startup that was making [a few million dollars a year](https://www.datanami.com/2023/07/06/what-is-mosaicml-and-why-is-databricks-buying-it-for-1-3b/) in revenue, for $1.3 billion. This year, Databricks bought [Tabular](https://tabular.io/), which is a piece of database middleware that was attempting to turn an open-source data format into a product, for [between one and two billion dollars](https://www.wsj.com/articles/databricks-to-buy-data-management-startup-tabular-in-bid-for-ai-clients-829e5bcf).

Neither deals were traditional nine-figure tech acquisitions, in which an acquirer is looking to buy a mature product, customers, and a revenue stream. Instead, they were both about hiring teams. In MosaicML, Databricks bought a bunch of experienced AI researchers (and some GPUs) in a bet that every [enterprise will eventually want to train their own LLM](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-modern-data-stack-was-never-big-enough?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20why%20Databricks%20paid%20such%20a%20premium%20for%20MosaicML%2C%20at%20a%20time%20when%20it%20could%E2%80%99ve%20acquired%20a%20number%20of%20modern%20data%20stack%20startups%20at%20a%20discount.). In Tabular, Databricks bought the architects of a popular open-source framework. When Databricks announced the acquisition, [they made absolutely no mention](https://www.databricks.com/blog/databricks-tabular) of the Tabular product, its business, or anything that had been created from the day after its founding. By all appearances, Databricks wasn’t interested in the company, its customers, its community, or even a single line of its code. What they wanted was “[the original Iceberg team](https://www.databricks.com/blog/databricks-tabular#:~:text=original%20Iceberg%20team%2C%20we%20are%20going%20to%20invest%20heavily%20to%20greatly%20broaden%20the%20ambitions%20of%20Delta%20Lake%20UniForm.%C2%A0Generally%20available%20today%2C%20UniForm%20allows%20companies%20to%20achieve%20compatibility.%20With%20the%20addition%20of%20the%20original%20Iceberg%20team%2C).”

That’s how the world seems to work in the [AI Upside Down](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-vibes-are-weird) we’re currently living in. Acquihires are no longer soft landings; they’re were all the money is. 

Because businesses can be valued in two ways: Based on their business fundamentals, or based on talent and hype. If you’re valued based on your business, [it’s brutal out there](https://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/clouded-judgement-53124-software). Revenue multiples are at historic lows, and investors punishing companies [that are growing slowly](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/salesforce-stock-fall-earnings-revenue-miss.html). 

But for companies that are are judged based on their teams, their valuations are effectively uncapped. A viral AI company founded by [gold-medalist engineers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-12/cognition-ai-is-a-peter-thiel-backed-coding-assistant) is worth [2 billion dollars in six months](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/six-month-old-ai-coding-startup-valued-at-2-billion-by-founders-fund). Another AI startup that has a bunch of employees with low [Erdos numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) to “[Attention is All You Need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need)” (Attention numbers? I don’t know) [raised 220 million dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/french-ai-startup-h-raises-220-million-seed-round/) less than a year after being founded. A company that builds a [Jeff Dunham puppet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Dunham#Characters) as a chatbot (and is definitely going to get [sued by Tesla shareholders](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html)) is worth [18 billion dollars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-25/musk-s-xai-startup-said-to-close-in-on-6-billion-fundraising?embedded-checkout=true), because Elon Musk. 

As always, [Russ Hanneman was right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzAdXyPYKQo): If you show revenue, people will ask how much, and it will never be enough. But if you have no revenue, you can be a pure AI play. And right now, no multiple is higher than the Attention number multiple.

[^2]: Well, sorta, we actually [bought some software](https://www.vanta.com/landing/soc-2) that did most of it for us in a few weeks. But the important thing is that [we have the certificate](https://www.ulc.org/), right?

[^4]: This isn’t entirely true. An internal account that Snowflake used for customer demos was compromised, because a Snowflake employee appears to have fallen victim to the same hacking campaign that Snowflake’s customers did. However, the information in that internal account wasn’t, it appears, used to hack into any other Snowflake accounts. It’s as though the hackers stole a bunch of PIN numbers from a bank’s customers, including the PIN number for one of the bank’s corporate checking accounts. It’s not a great look, but that PIN number didn’t give them access to anyone else’s PIN numbers.

[^5]: Username: zuck. Password: [dadada](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mark-zuckerbergs-twitter-and-pinterest-accounts-hacked-1465251954). No dice.

[^6]: Roughly, there are two types of vulnerabilities: Technical and social. Technical hacks are those that outwit the code itself—it’s like cracking a safe with a drill or by [Beautiful Minding the way the safe feels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7PvWTv3Jic). Social hacks are those that exploit people, like convincing someone that you’re their boss and you need them to send you their email password. Snowflake, and cloud software in general, is probably more *technically* secure than most self-hosted databases and applications, just as an ATM is probably more physically secure than a safe in someone’s house. But they are almost certainly less *socially* secure, because all hackers need to do is convince someone to give them their password in something like a fake password reset email.

[^7]: Although, for debit cards, you don’t even need to do that. You can just use “1234,” and you’ll be right [11 percent of the time](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/index.html).

[^8]: Compliance reports also serve the same function for customers. If a vendor gets hacked, the person who bought the software wants to be able to say it’s not their fault either. When Ticketmaster’s CEO calls their CIO into their office and asks [how they could’ve let this happen](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/31/live-nation-confirms-ticketmaster-was-hacked-says-personal-information-stolen-in-data-breach/), the CIO can say they did their diligence; Snowflake had all of the right credentials;  blame *them*.

[^9]: Imagine that the CEO of a software company has two dials in front of them. One controls the likelihood that their customers’ money and data gets stolen; the other controls the likelihood their company gets blamed for money and data being stolen. Nearly every CEO would set the first dial to 100 percent and the second dial to zero percent before they set both dials to one percent.

[^10]: Although sometimes, it’s about marketing. Does [Apple really care](https://x.com/ttunguz/status/1800593594434367535) that deeply about your privacy? Does *[Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1800265431078551973)*? Probably not. But they can sell privacy as a brand.

[^12]: They have to do some press, because there are often legal and contractual requirements to disclose these sorts of breaches.

# It’s too many options

*Burn the bike shed and sign some ten-year contracts. Plus, remembering that <LEAD.FAVORITE_COFFE_BRAND> cup in Game of Thrones.*

---

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Kcm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab891b3a-fbfc-458c-9447-b798a8f847b9_942x623.png)
*[repeat it five times in a row](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/kendrick-lamar-performs-not-like-us-five-times-la-show-1235714258/)*

I sometimes wonder if companies that buy software would be better off signing ten-year contracts rather than one-year contracts.

Typically, it’s buyers who want to sign short-term deals and sellers who want long-term ones. Go to almost any pricing page for a modern SaaS company, [and](https://app.slack.com/plans/T0VLPD22H) [you'll](https://asana.com/pricing) [see](https://zoom.us/pricing) [two](https://trello.com/pricing) [prices](https://workspace.google.com/pricing):[^1] A big, bold one, which you'll pay if you're billed annually, and a small, *higher* one, which you'll pay if you're billed monthly.[^2] And if you talk to any software vendor about signing an annual contract, they'll probably give a third option for a multi-year deal, which will have the lowest price of the three. 

The logic behind this sort of discounting is straightforward. For SaaS vendors, cash *commitments* are king. The entire business model [is built around customers staying customers](https://leadedge.com/why-we-like-saas-businesses/#:~:text=First%2C%20we%20like,a%20few%20bucks.) for a while and, to a lesser degree, [up-front payments](https://www.highalpha.com/blog/up-front-payments-fueling-saas-growth-without-dilution). Long-term deals offer both of these things.[^3] Moreover, in some sense, annual contracts are less work to maintain than monthly ones. If a company knows that a customer will be a customer for the next year, they don’t have to renew that customer’s business every month. For all these reasons, getting 10,000 dollars today is better than *probably *getting 1,000 dollars a month for the next 12 months, and SaaS companies often offer people that deal. 

They also offer the deal because buyers prefer short-term contracts. Buyers don’t want commitment; they want flexibility. What if they discover [some hidden flaw](https://deadstartuptoys.com/) in the product they bought? What if something about their business changes, and they no longer want to use it? What if a competitor launches a shiny new thing that [they really like](https://www.instagram.com/putmeon/reel/C8bNoT_oCGm/)? If they’re on a month-to-month contract, they can simply walk away. But if they’re on a long-term contract, they can’t. They can’t credibly demand that the vendor fix whatever thing they don’t like, “or else.” They can stop using the product, but [they can’t stop paying for it](https://www.barstoolsports.com/blog/3517358/the-dream-monty-williams-fired-after-1-season-will-make-dollar65-million-over-the-next-5-years-to-not-coach). They’re locked in. 

And so, [people say](https://www.spiceworks.com/hr/hr-strategy/articles/why-you-shouldnt-sign-a-3year-contract-for-an-hr-system/), when possible, [avoid it](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/vendor-lock-in/). Avoid long-term contracts. Month-to-month is better than an annual commitment; annual is better than multi-year; literally anything is better than *ten* years.

—

But is it? One of the common complaints that data people have about the state of the data industry today is that it’s too focused on tooling. We speculate on the implications of [Snowflake’s launches and Databricks’ acquisitions](https://www.blef.fr/databricks-snowflake-and-the-future); we waste time trying to define the [endless flavors](https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3399007513/) of [business intelligence](https://benn.substack.com/p/everything-is-still-bi); we talk about Modern Data Stack this and AI that. [As the memes say](https://x.com/matsonj/status/1590568105788731392), this is all a fun distraction from what we actually need to do: Fix people and process problems. Teams don’t need to optimize the handles on their hammers or the nuances of their nails; they need to become better carpenters. [The magic we’re looking for is in the work we’re avoiding.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/E0SkEQ1e3P0) 

I'm not totally sold by this argument [in the aggregate](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-product-is-the-process); we won’t all collectively become better craftspeople unless someone invents better hammers and nails. For individuals, though, tooling probably is a much [lower order bit](https://commoncog.com/highest-order-bit/) than skill, and talking about tooling is a form of technological [bikeshedding](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding). It's a science project; a hobby; an indulgence; an escape from the hard and often unpleasant work of dealing with people and [corporate politics](https://wrongbutuseful.substack.com/p/elbows-of-data). 

So, to summarize, there are two pieces of learned wisdom about technology and skills: 

But you see the contradiction? The first piece of advice says to maintain optionality—but the second says that the options you’re protecting are what colors to paint your bike shed. The first point implicitly encourages us to always be optimizing our tooling; the second point says do not get distracted by optimizing your tooling. 

However, if the second point is the more important one—which I think it is—there’s an easy way to be good at it: Do the *opposite* of the first point. *Choose* lock-in. Buy the BI tool; [burn the boats behind you](https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_d00.html); set your tools in stone. Force yourself to worry about people and process problems by taking away your other temptations.

If you’re in the market for some software product and you whittle your options down to a handful of reasonable finalists, all of those tools are probably good enough. Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, Synapse—does it really matter which you choose? Will “business outcomes” be materially different because the data team chooses a BI tool that its users give [4.60](https://www.g2.com/products/looker/reviews#reviews) stars versus [4.58](https://www.g2.com/products/sigma-computing-sigma/reviews#reviews)? Or [4.58](https://www.g2.com/products/thoughtspot/reviews#reviews) versus [4.56](https://www.g2.com/products/tableau/reviews#reviews)?[^4] How much are those 0.02 stars worth? Are they worth anything at all? Because the ability to move between those products, and upgrade from a 4.56 to a 4.60, is the optionality we’re paying for, in both foregone discounts and in the time we lose to distracting debates and product evaluations. 

It’s worse than that though, because optionality has an even bigger cost: Stability. If you invest in a single tool, you can probably wring more value out of it than you can by constantly trying to find something that’s marginally better. But people are unlikely to make that investment if they’re always window shopping for an upgrade.

Imagine a luxury apartment that’s leased by two people who are only committed to it until a better place comes on the market, and only committed to each other until they move. Now imagine a more pedestrian condo that a married couple owns. Which space is better? Imagine a college basketball team [of one-and-done freshmen](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/roster/_/id/96) who will be NBA lottery picks. Now imagine one full of [future insurance salesmen](https://x.com/DanSiegel_/status/1770976452118262036) who’ve been [playing together for several years](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/roster/_/id/2473). Which [team](https://x.com/CBSSports/status/1771018510103130209) is [better](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/game/_/gameId/401638593/oakland-kentucky)? 

In both cases, the stability of the latter option is at least arguably better than the talent of the former. And these are extreme cases, of college teams full of 1- and 2-star recruits versus 4- and 5-star recruits. When we buy software, we often sacrifice that stability, so that we can upgrade from a 4.56 star recruit to a 4.6 star recruit. 

There are business examples too. In his [14 key principles for management](https://deming.org/explore/fourteen-points/), W. Edwards Deming recommends that companies “move toward a single supplier for any one item, on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.” This is important, Deming says, because [quality requires consistency](https://www.uthsc.edu/its/business-productivity-solutions/lean-uthsc/deming.php#:~:text=Quality%20relies%20on%20consistency%20%E2%80%93%20the%20less%20variation%20you%20have%20in%20the%20input%2C%20the%20less%20variation%20you%27ll%20have%20in%20the%20output.). Multiple suppliers create variability and inconsistency; variable and inconsistent businesses struggle to improve. The same principle likely applies for having multiple software “suppliers.” Migrating between tools—or even just questioning if a tool is right, and always evaluating new ones—is a lot more disruptive than making the most out of something that might be missing a few of the latest features. 

The two main arguments against these sorts of long-term deals are, one, products can stagnate, and two, vendors can exploit long-term customers because they don’t need to earn their business anymore.

Though the first risk is real, it happens more slowly than most people imagine. Microstrategy, a 35-year old BI tool, has a rating of [4.4 stars](https://www.g2.com/products/microstrategy/reviews#reviews).[^5] Barring some extreme event, like a business collapse or a broken acquisition, most products don’t die overnight. 

The second risk actually seems backwards. Like Deming suggests, loyal long-term customers have more influence over their suppliers than fickle ones. Google may [not need to win](https://www.vox.com/2017/3/1/14661126/snap-snapchat-ipo-spending-2-billion-google-cloud) Snapchat’s business every year anymore, but Google *really* needs to win it every five years. As anyone who’s ever sold software before will tell you, it’s not the aggressive negotiators that keep you awake at night; it’s long-term customers who are gradually getting unhappy. Those are the accounts you can’t afford to lose, and the ones you bend over backwards to serve.

—

One piece of software that companies usually commit to for a while is their database. They may not sign long-term contracts, but databases often become so integrated with other systems that they're impractical to change. To replace BigQuery with Databricks, you have to move all of your data; you have to rewrite thousands of SQL queries written in a BigQuery accent into queries written in a Databricks accent; you have to update all the things that talk to Google’s APIs to now talk to Databricks’ APIs. It’s a pain, and people really try to avoid doing it.

That might be changing? Over the last couple weeks, Databricks and Snowflake announced [new commitments to Iceberg](https://thenewstack.io/snowflake-databricks-and-the-fight-for-apache-iceberg-tables/),[^6] which could make it easier to [swap one database with another](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/summit-season):[^7]

> If you eliminate data lock-in and allow workloads to “travel” between platforms based on cost / performance characteristics, you create a more efficient market for workloads. This allows competition to naturally push prices down over time.

Architecturally, seems great! The parts are more modular. Economically, also great! Lower prices; cheaper migrations. Wonderful.[^8] 

Practically, I’m not so sure. More optionality means more suppliers, more wandering eyes, and less stability. Optimizing compute engines and shuffling between databases could be a revolutionary innovation that [shifts paradigms by creating seamless integrations across scalable B2B SaaS products](https://x.com/james406/status/1803427733751410847)—or it could just become another bike shed for us to think about.

A few months ago, I said that the biggest failing of the modern data stack was its ambition to be [modular](https://benn.substack.com/p/llms-shouldnt-write-sql?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=the%20same%20time.-,Modularity,-.%20This%2C%20to). The theory sounds nice—a bunch of specialized Lego pieces, assembled together to meet exact needs of every customer, working in tightly integrated harmony around standard protocols and languages—but the reality is [it’s too many options](https://x.com/301mair/status/1803617254552056241):

> The [economics never worked](https://benn.substack.com/p/data-and-the-almighty-dollar) and the [experience was dysfunctional](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-modern-data-experience). Worse still, the belief in modularity helped inflate the bubble, by convincing people—and VCs—that there was space in the market for every specialized wedge.

Maybe we get this one right, and mix-and-match compute engines don’t suffer from these same problems. But the modern data stack shows that optionality creates plenty of problems too: Indecision, second-guessing, and lots of lower order bits to fiddle with. Sometimes, we might be better off just [picking one thing and sticking with it](https://x.com/dennisbhooper/status/1803834574025232814). 

# The ads are fake

This used to be one of my favorite interview questions:

> Imagine that you work for Starbucks. A few weeks into the final season of *Game of Thrones, *an HBO executive comes to you with an offer. 
> “Look”, they say, “the show has [gone to hell](https://www.change.org/p/hbo-remake-game-of-thrones-season-8-with-competent-writers).[^9] We’ve decided to throw all artistic integrity out the window, and to milk it for as much money as we can. So we’re here to offer you a deal. If you pay us enough money, we’ll leave a [Starbucks cup in a shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF5v0Y1uM7g) in one of the final episodes. [Ten million people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_of_Thrones_episodes#Season_8_(2019)) will see it. [It will go viral.](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/05/231863/game-of-thrones-starbucks-coffee-cup-memes-season-8) It will become a meme. Everyone will be talking about Starbucks. Imagine the promotional possibilities. Starkbucks. The [winter menu](https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2024/starbucks-launches-winter-menu-with-new-iced-hazelnut-oatmilk-shaken-espresso-and-the-return-of-pistachio/) is coming. I don’t know, we obviously can’t write anymore, you’ll think of something good. Anyway. How much are you be willing to pay us to do this?”
> What do you offer HBO?

I have no idea what the right answer is (the point of the question was to see how people think through it, not to calculate an actual number), but it doesn’t seem like it’d be very much? Product placement ads aren’t very targeted, so the average impression for something like this would likely be a good bit less valuable than the average impression of a search or social media ad. 

But what if it could be targeted? What if HBO said they’d only show the Starbucks cup to people who recently went to Starbucks? What if they could offer the same deal to Dunkin’ Donuts, and promised to only show a Dunkin’ cup to people who live within ten miles of a store?

We may be getting there. [From the ](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/style/tiktok-ads-ai-influencers.html)*[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/style/tiktok-ads-ai-influencers.html)*[:](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/style/tiktok-ads-ai-influencers.html)

> On Monday, TikTok [announced](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/blog/tiktok-symphony-ai-creative-suite) a new set of tools that will allow brands to create ads using avatars generated by artificial intelligence that look like real people. There will be two types of avatars, TikTok said in a release. Brands can choose from an array of stock avatars “created from video footage of real paid actors that are licensed for commercial use,” or they can opt for a customizable avatar that could be designed to look like a specific creator. 

Right now, TikTok is only using generative AI to help advertisers create ads before they serve them. But eventually, surely the same technology will get used to create ads *when* they serve them. If we can animate a fake avatar to read a transcript, we can animate the same avatar to read a customized transcript that speaks directly to whoever is seeing it. Talk about a product they recently searched for. Speak in their native language. Adjust the avatar’s age and appearance to make them appear as trustworthy as possible to the specific person they’re talking to.

And if we do this, why would we stop with content that’s explicitly an ad? Watch a James Bond movie on Netflix, and transform his car into whatever make the people on that account might buy. It’s no longer an Aston Martin; it’s a Toyota Sienna. Do the same for his watch; his suit; his sunglasses.

Each of us live in our own version of the internet. First, it was because the internet gave us more options: Rather than everyone getting news from a couple broadcast networks and major newspapers, we could choose the sites and blogs that we liked. Then, it was the ads: Our individual browsing histories followed us around, and we all saw ads that were personalized to our presumed preferences.[^10] And more recently, it’s become our feeds: Tiktok, Twitter, and Netflix show us posts and videos that their algorithms think we’ll like. 

Still, though we might each see a different kaleidoscope of content, each individual piece is consistent. Our online mosaics are manufactured, but other people share some of the same tiles. 

But maybe not for much longer? After all, why show people a real tile, when a modified one might get them to buy an extra cup of coffee?

[^5]: On one hand, companies game their G2 scores by harassing their best customers in writing reviews, so this is a pretty suspect source. On the other hand, if there’s any signal in these scores at all, Microstrategy is still decaying remarkably slowly. It’s a [month older](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/34-43724#:~:text=MicroStrategy%20was%20incorporated%20in%20Delaware%20in%20November%201989.) than [Taylor Swift](https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/taylor-swift.html)!

There is physical data, stored in files on a drive. The database organizes those files in some manner that makes them easy to retrieve. And when you ask the database for data, a computer uses its organizational scheme to look up the files you asked for. Historically, different databases have used different systems for organizing their shelves—e.g., Redshift might arrange its books alphabetically by author, while Snowflake might order them by length. This meant that compute engines—the librarians—couldn’t share the same physical library of books, because those librarians needed the books to be organized according to whatever version of the Dewey Decimal System they knew how to use. Iceberg is an open-source Dewey Decimal System. If everyone agrees to organize their books that way, then different database compute engines could all share one set of books. That would make it much easier for people to choose the right librarians for the right jobs, because they wouldn’t have to rearrange their entire library first.

[^7]: By database, I mean “database compute engine,” because [I don’t know what a database is anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynwKC3ynB_w).

[^8]: Cynically, none of this will actually matter that much, because Databricks and Snowflake aren’t collaborating on a new standard; they’re each trying to become the center of the new standard. Though that may create some overlap today, with everyone making a big show about how much they love Iceberg, it seems inevitable that their real goals are to add their own features on top of Iceberg, and then try to convince everyone that their version is *the* version everyone should standardize around.

*[“I want the certificate.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v38lu0Bi0Kk)*

In late 2019, [Away](https://www.awaytravel.com/), a startup that sells luggage, had a problem. Weeks earlier, a handful of Away employees sent *The Verge *screenshots of Steph Korey, the company’s then 31-year-old founder and CEO, berating staff for, in her view, not working hard enough, not being devoted to Away’s customers enough, not living up to Away’s values enough, and, in one case where she questioned if some employees were “brain dead,” not being cognitively animated enough. After [interviewing a number of former employees](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995453/away-luggage-ceo-steph-korey-toxic-work-environment-travel-inclusion) who described the messages as “consistent with a pattern of behavior from the company’s top leaders,” *The Verge* published a lengthy piece charging Korey with creating a “toxic work environment” inside of Away. 

[Korey tweeted an apology](https://people.com/travel/ceo-of-luggage-company-away-steps-down-after-being-accused-of-fostering-toxic-work-environment/), said she was “appalled and embarrassed” by her behavior, promised to better support her team through an awkward commitment to “work-life integration,” and, three days later, was fired.[^1] [Away replaced Korey with Stuart Haselden](https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-luggage-startup-away-says-ceo-is-stepping-down-11575930577), a former Lululemon executive with over twenty years of retail experience.[^2] Then Korey returned as CEO, saying the initial decision [was a mistake](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/business/steph-korey-away.html) and that *The Verge* story [contained](https://www.businessinsider.com/away-ceo-calls-company-investigation-deliberate-lies-2020-1) “deliberate lies and distortions.”[^3]

Korey’s firing [sparked](https://twitter.com/vcstarterkit/status/1203169692384296960) a number of the tech industry’s long-standing cultural powder kegs. [The real story was inequality](https://twitter.com/vcstarterkit/status/1203180724330778624): If Korey, who grew up in a 55,000 square foot home and was at one point [worth $130 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2019/05/15/luggage-startup-aways-founders-steph-korey-and-jen-rubio-worth-130m-each-after-recent-fundraise/#7ebf60938f46), wanted her team to work harder, she should pay them more than $40,000 a year. [The real story was about inexperienced management](https://twitter.com/vcstarterkit/status/1203177461661351936): Rather than yelling at her support team, Korey should’ve been focused on figuring out why Away was getting [4,000 customer service requests](https://twitter.com/vcstarterkit/status/1203186414327721989) a day. [The real story was Slack](https://twitter.com/vcstarterkit/status/1203178343857737730): Away’s reliance on always-on chat and Korey’s insistence that employees “have almost every conversation in public” enabled executives to surveil and intimidate staff. [The real story was racism](https://www.insideedition.com/away-scandal-inside-journalists-investigation-into-luggage-start-ups-toxic-workplace-environment): Several people of color said that they were fired by Away because they made jokes about “[cis white men](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995453/away-luggage-ceo-steph-korey-toxic-work-environment-travel-inclusion#:~:text=Korey%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20comment%20on%20what%20people%20had%20said%20in%20the%20channel%20that%20she%20determined%20was%20racist.)” in a private Slack channel. [The real story was sexism](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2019/12/13/the-unfair-treatment-of-away-co-founder-and-ceo-stephanie-korey/#20ed758c1146): Had Korey been a man, she would’ve been seen as decisive rather than tyrannical.[^4] [The real story was the media](https://twitter.com/vcstarterkit/status/1203173742001586176): The article was a hit piece—targeting both Away and [Slack](https://twitter.com/vcstarterkit/status/1203190900114853893)—uncovering nothing remarkable, written by a reporter with an ax to grind. 

It [scissored](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/) Silicon Valley in half.[^5] For a few weeks, no matter your team or [tribe](https://benn.substack.com/p/tribal-accelerationism), you had an opinion on what happened at Away, and it proved that you had been right all along.

The biggest nerve it touched, however, centered around the pressure that Korey, who was known for having a [fanatical work ethic](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995453/away-luggage-ceo-steph-korey-toxic-work-environment-travel-inclusion#:~:text=fanatical%20work%20ethic), put on her employees to work long hours, over weekends, and over holidays. Some argued that this expectation was abusive; others said it was necessary, the cost of doing business as a young company.[^6] 

This debate over work-life balance was not new; it’s a fault line that frequently shakes up Silicon Valley’s chattering class. Elon Musk [regularly dislodges it](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ev3b3p/dont-work-80-hours-a-week-for-elon-musk-or-anyone) by encouraging people to work [80 to 100 hours a week](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1067175527180513280); Basecamp founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson [dislodged it](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/06/success/jason-fried-basecamp-work/index.html) when they [published a book](https://www.amazon.com/Doesnt-Have-Be-Crazy-Work/dp/0062874780) arguing that long hours are “a mark of stupidity;” every viral [#DayInMyLife video](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/techtok-layoff-day-in-the-life-videos-rcna67669) from TikTok [dislodges it](https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1561096423243800576). And Steph Korey inadvertently dislodged it by, among other things, preemptively rejecting her support team’s requests for time off in the name of accountability and empowerment.

In this iteration, most of Korey's defenders didn't condone her approach—people couldn’t quite contort themselves into saying that calling her team braindead was reasonable. But many people, and especially venture capitalists and their social barnacles, defended her willingness to do whatever it takes to succeed. Rather than criticizing her managerial style, they said, [we should applaud](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2019/12/13/the-unfair-treatment-of-away-co-founder-and-ceo-stephanie-korey/?sh=4479d9b51146) her “strong devotion” to her customers and her “meticulous care about the integrity of the product offered.” As [one anonymous venture capitalist said](https://twitter.com/vcstarterkit/status/1203223845492031488), "many VCs are reading it and recognizing the culture as the one they would love to see across their portfolio.”

Fair enough; building a company *is* hard. Most companies won't succeed unless the people building them are obsessively devoted to that endeavor.[^7] 

But that’s where the story takes an odd twist: Away was, by any reasonable measure, already successful. By early 2018, [Away was profitable](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/away-raises-50-million-announces-it-reached-profitability-in-under-two-years-300673673.html). Korey’s personal stake in Away was likely worth tens of millions of dollars. Away’s flagship product [received a “nearly flawless” score](https://www.wired.com/review/review-away-carry-on/) on *Wired* and [was called](https://www.vogue.com/article/away-luggage-direct-to-consumer-business-launch) the “perfect carry-on” by *Vogue*. They had a [podcast](https://x.com/away/status/869945248486764544), a [magazine](https://x.com/away/status/986266214296104960) full of celebrities, and a *[Forbes](https://x.com/ForbesUnder30/status/1071170239369502722)*[ cover](https://x.com/ForbesUnder30/status/1071170239369502722). 

In other words, what was Korey still chasing? Why did Away need to raise [another $100 million](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/away-packs-on-100m/)? Why did it need 50 new stores and [to build “a community”](https://x.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1129334145505796097) for people who bought suitcases? And why did she need to pursue those things with such relentless urgency that she forfeited her own managerial values—Korey had [previously said](https://business.columbia.edu/lang-letter/columbia-business/day-life-steph-korey-15-founder-and-ceo-away) that “you can’t be your most productive self if you’re not taking time to unplug,” and Away’s [mission statement](https://www.trueself.com/away-suitcase-travel-adventure-easier-2540842831.html#:~:text=For%20us%2C%20all%20time%20away%20is%20time%20well%20spent) once said that “all time away is time well spent”—to do so?

To people in tech, the answers to these questions are so self-evident that we barely recognize them as questions at all. She did it because that’s what you do when you start a company. If your company sells software, you build great software. If it sells luggage, suitcases—and “getting more out of every trip,” another part of Away’s mission—becomes your singular calling. You become passionate about resilient yet functionally minimal roller bags, or [enterprise identity and access management](https://www.okta.com/), or [solving payroll](https://gusto.com/), or whatever. You go big, and then try to go bigger. In Silicon Valley, we’ve drowned ourselves so deeply in this ethos that we [no longer realize that we’re in the water](http://bulletin-archive.kenyon.edu/x4280.html).

# One ruler to reign them all 

In 2011, I was desperate, in a way that only a trophy-chasing twenty-four millennial can be desperate: My first job out of college, a junior analyst at a think tank in Washington, DC, was stalling, my grad school applications had been rejected, and I was running out of blue chip consulting firms, investment banks, and tech companies to apply to. Like so many other applicants for those positions, I didn’t know if I’d like doing these jobs; I only knew I’d like them on my resume. They weren’t passions, or even hobbies; they were the [next opportunity for extrinsic validation](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2011/09/30/even-artichokes-have-doubts/#:~:text=next%20opportunity%20for%20extrinsic%20validation). Thus far, the arc of my life—apply to college, go to college, apply for a vaguely prestigious job or smug fellowship, take the most notable one—had been mapped by others, and I figured I’d again drift towards my next “success.” 

I did not make it as far as I’d hoped. After a six-month job search, I landed my first offer on my fifty-ninth application: A data analyst at a San Francisco tech startup with a puzzling product, a [clumsy name](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yammer), and, as their *MTV Cribs*-themed recruiting video enthusiastically put it, “Cheetos, Fritos, *and* Doritios!” It wasn’t the glowing gold star that I was looking for, but with no alternative, I took the job. 

When I got to Silicon Valley in 2012, I was indistinguishable from many of the other new arrivals. We were young; we were educated; we were mostly white, mostly male, and mostly free of student debt. We preferred to wear jeans, drink IPAs, and talk about things—technology trends, SF housing policy, bourbon—as if we knew more about them than we did. Though it would take some time for me to be fully manufactured into a tech bro—for example, I still wore The North Face rather than Patagonia, SF’s preferred corporate athleisure—I was grade A raw material.

I was also primed for indoctrination in a more important way: I was ambitious. Despite the Bay Area’s cultural and natural richness, I, like most people flooding into San Francisco’s central neighborhoods, didn’t come for those things. I came for my career. I came to succeed. I came to “have an impact.”  At what or on what, I didn’t know. But in a city overflowing with achievement, I assumed I’d figure it out.

Within a few weeks of being in San Francisco, I hadn’t figured out what it meant to be successful in tech—I’d been run over by it. The three most common things I learned about my new coworkers were their name, their job title, and how early they joined the company. Days after I started, we [celebrated raising](https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/29/enterprise-social-networking-platform-yammer-raises-85m-from-dfj-growth-khosla-and-others/) nearly $100 million in funding—until, a few weeks later, [Facebook bought Instagram](https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/04/09/facebook-buys-instagram-for-1-billion/), a company half our age and a fifth our size, for $1 billion. We lionized coworkers who left to join smaller companies or start their own; we wrote off coworkers who left for established giants like Google or Amazon, as if they were retiring.[^8]

That was the only ruler by which we measured ourselves in San Francisco: How much money had your employer raised, how much hype did it have, and how early did you join? This singular scoreboard hung over everything—in every bar, at every Meetup™, inside every Yoga studio and CrossFit gym, on every date. In the tech bubble, there were no alternative measures of success, like there might be more professionally diverse cities. If you were to pick 20 random people out of a bar in New York or San Diego or Memphis, and ask them to sort themselves by social status, they’d probably disagree about the arrangement. How do you compare a dental hygienist to a teacher to a bike shop owner to an accountant? Why would you compare them at all? 

But ask 20 people at [The Snug](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JULWvkZ26ggUf2sq9) on Fillmore Street, and everyone would give the same answer. In fact, you don’t even need to ask—people who work in tech often arrange themselves by their professional strata on their own. In San Francisco, we are our jobs, we keep score, and we all know who’s winning. We have a scale, and we use it. 

The Bay Area isn’t entirely special in this regard; DC, for example, is also dominated by one industry, and full of young careerists who are hunting the same jobs. But Silicon Valley’s giant social scoreboard has one unique complication: The innate ambition of San Francisco’s startup class is also supercharged by the tech industry’s obsession with “growth.” We don’t value people by where they are. We value them in the same way we value our companies—by how fast they’re rising. Nobody talks about the CEO of a public company that’s growing at ten percent a year, or the Oracle SVP who’d been an SVP for a decade. We talked about the people and companies *on the cusp*—the rocket ships, the wunderkinds, [the new new things](https://www.amazon.com/New-Thing-Silicon-Valley-Story/dp/0393347818). 

For better or for worse, in San Francisco, these vertical trajectories feel possible. Unlike other prestige professions, the tech industry celebrates those who skip to the front of the line. Startups have no entry level analyst program, no obligatory MBA hiatus, no rotational associate sequence, no residencies, no defined timelines for becoming a partner or managing director. In Silicon Valley, "paying your dues" is hearsay. Through the breathless profiles that fill *Forbes,* [VC blogs](https://web.archive.org/web/20221027181005/https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-spotlight/), and countless *30 Under 30* lists, startup founders are regularly reminded about those who became rich and famous by refusing to be told they weren’t ready. 

And so, we all chase a definition of success that can only be measured by how much faster we were moving than our peers. Every step we take, every hour of work we put in, feels like an urgent acceleration towards… something. Fueled by our time and other people’s money, we race one another to the horizon.

# A passion for whatever’s nearby

I have no idea if any of this mattered to Steph Korey. But there are a lot of parallels between her career and my own, and I know that they mattered to *me*. We both graduated from college the same year. We both [worked at NGOs](https://www.crainsnewyork.com/awards/40-under-40-2019-steph-korey) before moving to corporate jobs. Both of us started companies—Korey started Away and I started Mode, which built software for data analysts—in our mid- to late twenties. 

Moreover, both of us were opportunistic founders. According to [one profile of Korey](https://web.archive.org/web/20201123030035/https://foundr.com/steph-korey-away), she didn’t start Away because of any particular passion for luggage; she started it because her friend’s carry-on split open on an international flight. Despite initially being unsure if she wanted to start a business, Korey’s reluctance turned into cheeky ambition. “We weren’t interested in starting a small business,” [she told ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesstylefile/2016/02/23/designer-spotlight-away-luggage-launches-a-tech-friendly-quality-carry-on-for-todays-traveler/#6ddf2a73d7af:~:text=We%20weren%E2%80%99t%20interested%20in%20starting%20a%20small%20business%3B%20we%20wanted%20to%20truly%20improve%20how%20people%20travel%20on%20a%20meaningful%20scale.)*[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesstylefile/2016/02/23/designer-spotlight-away-luggage-launches-a-tech-friendly-quality-carry-on-for-todays-traveler/#6ddf2a73d7af:~:text=We%20weren%E2%80%99t%20interested%20in%20starting%20a%20small%20business%3B%20we%20wanted%20to%20truly%20improve%20how%20people%20travel%20on%20a%20meaningful%20scale.)*, “we wanted to truly improve how people travel on a meaningful scale.”

Similarly, prior to starting Mode, I had no interest in business intelligence software. I started it because two of my coworkers at Yammer built a [popular internal tool](https://benn.substack.com/i/78395588/how-mode-fails), and they inexplicably [offered me a seat](https://benn.substack.com/p/to-my-parents?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=Though%20I%20had,their%20entrepreneurial%20coattails.) at their founding table. But once in it, I was in it—trying to reinvent dashboards; writing countless blog posts about dashboards; being called, by the cruelest person on LinkedIn, a [leader in the dashboarding space](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leader-in-dashboarding.png).[^9]

In other words, Korey and I both stumbled into our respective businesses. Neither of us were building something that the world especially needed. And like so many founders and company leaders who get swept up in feverish ambitions and pace of startup life, we didn’t create businesses to manufacture products for customers; not *really*. We created them to manufacture accomplishment for ourselves. We just wanted to succeed; to win; to outclimb our peers. 

In tech, that’s not an ignoble cause. Sequoia Capital, a premier venture firm, [believes that](https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/pat-grady/) all of their investments should “have a desperate need to win.” In the wake of Kobe Bryant’s death, Marc Andreessen [marked the occasion](https://x.com/pmarca/status/1221530843379728384) by reminding people that one of Kobe’s most admirable characteristics was his atomic obsession with winning. Others have [explicitly drawn parallels](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/why-i-look-for-obsessive-and-competitive-founders-82076ec0e9e2) between Kobe and successful founders for the same reason.

I get why VCs say this stuff. It’s visceral; it’s provocative; it gets the people going. As a lifelong amateur athlete, my YouTube history is littered with [Tiger fist pumps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_tkJEAGMDE), [kick-sixes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiuejtLXt0), [buzzer beaters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTThyQPoXxY&t=156s) and [double bangs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L34X0mUdTyk),[^10] [bat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdbOxI2N7I&t=43s) [flips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V8W6_bD7bE&t=225s), [home](https://x.com/MLB/status/1153123924437323776) [run](https://x.com/LasMayores/status/1115101985081036802) [mics](https://x.com/Jolly_Olive/status/1787670163841495365), [Nike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8yOG3qYk08) and [Under Armour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmvaPQi-Jgo) ads, and [Minneapolis Miracle remixes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KBCTjuRBo). Without a court to compete on, startups became our arena. And we become as monomaniacal about winning our game as [athletes and coaches](https://x.com/ClaireMPLS/status/1805354397930770780) are about winning theirs.

There is nothing inherently wrong with that. People need competition; they need meaning; we cannot just [gaze into the abyss](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780191843730.001.0001/q-oro-ed5-00007886#:~:text=He%20who%20fights%20with%20monsters,abyss%20gazes%20also%20into%20you.) of our fleeting existence on a [lonely mote of dust](https://www.planetary.org/worlds/pale-blue-dot) floating through an eternal void. [We all have religions](http://bulletin-archive.kenyon.edu/x4280.html#:~:text=Because%20here%27s%20something,And%20so%20on.) because we all *need* religions. If someone finds purpose in building Instagramable totes, that is no more or less cosmically relevant than anything else. And on a more planetary scale, it’s probably not a bad thing for some people to be entrepreneurs [for the love of the game](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/mission-or-game)—or even, [just for the trophies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v38lu0Bi0Kk). Suitcases may not be metaphysically material, but a nice one does make flying [a little less of a headache](https://benn.substack.com/p/open-the-window).[^11]

Instead, what I think is important to recognize about our motivations is not that they are bad; *it is that they are circumstantial*. Thousands of people in Silicon Valley meander into their ambitions, via [pivots](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/instagram-used-to-be-called-brbn/373815/), via [pranks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/11/channeling-the-social-network-lawmaker-grills-zuckerberg-on-his-notorious-beginnings/), or—as seemed to happen for me and Korey—via professional serendipity. But just as we can wander into our life’s calling, we can wander out.

# Is that all there is to a firing?

There is one more parallel between my career and Steph Korey’s: We both got fired from our startups. ThoughtSpot, which [acquired Mode](https://mode.com/blog/mode-founders-note-thoughtspot-acquisition) almost exactly a year ago, [let me go](https://benn.substack.com/p/oops?utm_source=publication-search#footnote-anchor-1-143303690:~:text=First%2C%20oops,for%20the%20ecosystem.) two months ago. 

So it goes; such is the circle of life in Silicon Valley. If you don’t like that deal, don’t work here. Still, the moment was striking to me, not in what it was, but in what it was not. For years, you don’t just work somewhere; you are consumed by it. The things that matter to you are the things that matter to it. For better or for worse, it puts blinders on your ambitions: You obsess over success in your field, and wonder why people in other fields stress about the trivial status games in theirs.[^12] 

And then…you don’t. Your calendar is cleared; your to-do list is zeroed; your problems are suddenly someone else's responsibility. You're pulled from the water that you long ago forgot was water, and dropped directly onto the land. 

Standing on the shore, your old pond—the pond where you did your life's work, in which nothing seemed more important than being a big fish—suddenly looks like all the other ponds you used to care so little about. [It looks distant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCRZZC-DH7M); foreign; trivial. From that vantage point, you don't mourn leaving it; you mourn having spent so much time there.

That doesn't mean it didn’t matter. It simply means that our ambitions are defined by our environment. On short time scales, this is obvious; in the moments that we desperately [crave tacos](https://www.forallthingsgoodbk.com/), or a quiet moment to ourselves, or a cold shower, we know that we won’t want them forever. In a couple hours, we’ll be full and [repulsed by food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3K7Qc6vW5Q); in a couple days, we'll want to [pop out with some friends](https://x.com/kirawontmiss/status/1803615172491162018); in a couple months, we’ll want a hot shower and cozy blanket.

The same is true over longer time scales; it’s just harder to see. When you’ve been on a ten-year trek looking for a taco, you forget that you might one day want something else. 

This has a corollary that is even harder to see, and harder still to act on. *You can manufacture ambition*. Being a suitcase executive, building data software, chasing status in Silicon Valley—these are not innate in us. We care about these things because we submerged ourselves in them, became acclimated to it, and forgot that it was water. 

But there are other ponds that we could lose ourselves in. If you start going to pottery classes, suddenly pottery will be your thing. If you become a barista, [a guy on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@jameshoffmann) might become your idol. If you work in sports media, you’ll find yourself caring about [this gossip](https://x.com/JohnDeMarsico/status/1806373106530828663) and not [that gossip](https://x.com/SeattleDataGuy/status/1804277685037723836). We think that we surround ourselves with our interests, but causality often runs the other way: We become interested in what we’re surrounded by.

We can choose that context—it just takes a leap of faith. As long as your environment stays the same, so will your ambitions. You’ll value the same things as you did yesterday, care about the opinions of the same people, and chase the same trophies. If you change this context, these things will change too. But that’s the uncomfortable order it has to happen: You won’t want something new until you walk away from the thing you currently want. 

That’s the real trap of Silicon Valley, and of other prestige industries. For aimless high-achievers—for people whose only honest answer to the question of “what do you want to be when you grow up?” is “successful”—they offer a default scale. And then, its scale becomes our scale. Though we start out working there *despite* the job being about shifting paradigms across scalable B2B SaaS, we eventually work there *because* the job is about shifting paradigms across scalable B2B SaaS. That’s the real punchline to [this joke](https://x.com/james406/status/1803427733751410847): If you work in tech long enough, this might actually become what you love. 

And maybe that’s ok. But at a minimum, we shouldn’t [find our ambitions by accident](https://x.com/netcapgirl/status/1806529320271188402).  If we imagine that we’re no longer in our current pond—that we got fired, or are 16 years old and dreaming about what we to do with our life, or [80 years old](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/02/jeff-bezos-this-is-what-you-are-going-to-regret-at-80.html) and reflecting on what we did—what would we care about then? Are the ladders we spent our time climbing the ladders that we really want to stand at the top of?

Whatever we imagine that existential ambition will be then, we we can make it our day-to-day ambition now, but not without sacrificing our current idols. Because there will be a moment when all have to ask ourselves if we got what [we wanted from this life](https://wordsfortheyear.com/2014/07/07/late-fragment-by-raymond-carver/), and the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing us he'd come for us after we die, and [not when we're still living](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44982/richard-cory).

[^2]: Away initially said that the change had been in the works for months. This [was later reported](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/11/21003305/away-luggage-ceo-steph-korey-stuart-haselden-culture) to be partially true. Haselden had been planning on joining before *The Verge* story, but as COO, not CEO.

[^3]: Nine months later, in October of 2020, Korey [stepped down again](https://www.axios.com/2020/10/15/steph-korey-steps-down-as-aways-ceo-again).

[^4]: On one hand, the tech industry definitely idolizes men—Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison, Andy Grove, Travis Kalanick, many more—when they are notoriously demanding. On the other hand, maybe we shouldn’t? To assume that they were great because they were jerks is like assuming John McEnroe was great because he threw tantrums. I get that greatness can often be prickly, and you can’t throw out the outbursts without potentially losing the passion. But we don’t need to celebrate or mimic that behavior; we can aspire to be more decent. For every Steve Jobs, there are thousands of us with less talent whose tempers don’t make us great leaders; they just make us cruel.

[^5]: Away is neither a tech company [nor located in Silicon Valley](https://www.areadevelopment.com/newsitems/5-22-2018/away-headquarters-new-york-city.shtml). However, the Silicon Valley metonym has grown to include venture-backed startups in other major U.S. cities like New York, Boston, Austin, and, [for a minute](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/09/12/miami-tech-boomlet-flames-out-but-promise-remains/f00917c6-515a-11ee-accf-88c266213aac_story.html), Miami. Silicon Valley isn’t a place; [it’s a mentality](https://twitter.com/Hadley/status/1700153039615598718).

[^6]: On “work-life balance,” some people take jobs to get rich, because they’re compulsively ambitious, and because they’re hypnotized by the thrill of explosive growth. Some people take jobs to work on interesting problems, to work with supportive teams, and simply to make enough money to have lives outside of their offices. A lot of startups try to have it both ways. They try to offer rides on a rocketship while also putting people and culture first. And when the two are at odds, [they gaslight employees](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995453/away-luggage-ceo-steph-korey-toxic-work-environment-travel-inclusion) by camouflaging oppressive hours as “wild and exciting and unexpected and beautiful.” Other industries like finance are at least direct about what they offer: They pay you a lot of money to steamroll you with work. It may be abusive, but it’s transparent.That’s why I think startups [should be more explicit](https://benn.substack.com/p/your-companys-values-will-be-used) about how they make these tradeoffs. It’s fine to chase growth at all costs, to build a company and culture that prioritizes the lifestyle of its employees first, or to do something in the middle. But everyone needs to know which temple they’re in. Also—a lot of people seem to see this as a choice between winning and gently losing. But this misses the point.* *We don’t have to define winning around money or market dominance. We can also define it through how much we enjoy the responsibilities that fill our days, or how we support the lives of those we employ. We can still be competitive; we can still have a desperate need to win; we can still [refuse to process failure](https://x.com/pmarca/status/1221530843379728384). We just have to be independently-minded enough to not let others define what winning and losing means.

[^7]: Similarly, VCs’ livelihoods—or at least their statuses, their Twitter audiences, their invites to the All-In Summit, and their futures as authors of pop management books with glowing introductions from authors of other pop management books—depend on their portfolios surviving.

[^8]: Later that year, Microsoft “retired” us all by buying Yammer. We scoffed at their offices, their stale software products, and their bureaucratic performance management practices. We quit, sold our Microsoft shares, and started companies that would build things, and not just [tell stories about the glory days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL-VX3WbA9U). Most of those companies are out of business. Microsoft’s shares are up 1,500 percent, and it is now the most valuable company in the world. Ah well.

[^9]: I mean, oh man, does a message like this make you question your life choices.

[^10]: It’s funny now, because [they’re the same team](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8qXPR-Nse4/).

[^11]: That said, this can also cause problems. In 1838, Abraham Lincoln [said this about ambition](https://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/lyceum.htm#:~:text=It%20sees%20no%20distinction%20in%20adding%20story%20to%20story%2C%20upon%20the%20monuments%20of%20fame%2C%20erected%20to%20the%20memory%20of%20others.%20It%20denies%20that%20it%20is%20glory%20enough%20to%20serve%20under%20any%20chief.%20It%20scorns%20to%20tread%20in%20the%20footsteps%20of%20any%20predecessor%2C%20however%20illustrious):It sees no distinction in adding story to story, upon the monuments of fame, erected to the memory of others. It denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief. It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor, however illustrious.No doubt, society benefits from some degree of gamified entrepreneurship. But there can be a point at which that goes too far, and rather than working together, every great creator wants their own solo career.

[^12]: For example, there are legions of Zoomers who are obsessed with their social standing on Instagram and TikTok. Do you care about what these people think? Does their game *matter*? If that totem pole isn’t important, isn’t it possible to imagine that one day yours may not be either?
