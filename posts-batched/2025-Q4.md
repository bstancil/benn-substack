*A last exit.*

I think about the interstate sometimes. Between San Francisco and New York, between New York and Los Angeles, between Los Angeles and Philadelphia and New Orleans and every other city in the United States, there is an uninterrupted artery of pavement. Pick any two points on a map, and they are not only connected by a single, spidering blacktop; but you can also draw a line from one to the other without ever encountering an obstacle, a stop light, or even an intersection. Somehow, despite millions of people crisscrossing the country every day, there is always a path to go from where you are to where you are going in [one long, continuous sprint](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEuAgaZJav-/).

There is an metaphor here, if you want to make one. Startups, despite having a name that suggests a beginning—which seems to also imply the existence of an end, or at least, an evolution—are often one long, continuous sprint. [Go fast, forever](https://benn.substack.com/p/live-like-youre-dying#:~:text=take%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20that%3A-,Go%20fast%2C%20forever,-.%20Maintain%20perpetual%20urgency). Those who find themselves on that highway, they know the feelings that it shares with those of a road trip: There is a destination—an IPO, an acquisition, [the promise of peace in two weeks](https://benn.substack.com/p/live-like-youre-dying#:~:text=So%20another%20friend%20and%20I%20had%20a%20different%20joke%3A%20%22It%27ll%20get%20better%20in%20two%20weeks.%22)—but it always seems to stretch just beyond the curve of the horizon. Are we there yet? We are [perpetually halfway there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Dichotomy_paradox); it is still [day 1](https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/how-amazon-defines-and-operationalizes-a-day-1-culture/); we are only [two percent done](https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2024/thoughtspot-s-new-ceo-ai-is-the-new-bi). There are mileage markers, like [fundraising rounds and big hires](https://benn.substack.com/p/live-like-youre-dying#:~:text=Between%20my%20friend%20and%20I%2C%20it%20became%20a%20meme%3A), that tease our progress. There are pockets of debilitating traffic that wear us down; there are near-miss accidents that nearly kill us; there are stretches of [open road and a whole lot of speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-S-PaMWhwI); and there are, most of all, [hours of absolutely nothing](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFEDbbQpD9U), and the grind of an empty, exhausting drive.

But there is something more subtle about roadtrips, and about startups: Their stories don’t translate. So much is lost in the telling. The misery of inching through clouds of tar and construction dust does not sound, in the grand scheme of things, all that miserable. The [barreling mountain wind](https://www.instagram.com/p/CE9vcrrp24W) loses its divinity, when you put it into words. The Colorado sunset does not fit on an iPhone.

But if you were there, in the car, you would understand. You would’ve also wondered if we were going to die in that slug of traffic. You would’ve seen that canvas of a thousand shades of orange, stretching into the cosmos. And you would’ve also felt how the road bends time—how the last thirty minutes before the hotel feels like three hundred; how quickly [a sun rises](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEvFzwBp3lM/) and how [slowly it sets](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFFafLcJB4J/?img_index=1); and how, amid the hypnotic hum of the engine, the hours detach themselves, and you become a [loose photon](https://bigthink.com/hard-science/photon-experience-light-speed/), blasting down a timeline all your own.

So it is with startups. From the outside, the hard parts look easy, because, in the grand scheme of things, [they are](https://benn.substack.com/p/ambition-fun-and-not#:~:text=Here%20is%20a%20conversation%20you%20might%20imagine%20a%2030%2Dyear%2Dold%20having%20with%20Jensen%20Huang%2C%20the%20founder%20of%20Nvidia%20and%20tenth%2Drichest%20person%20on%20earth%3A). The successes look mundane, because there are always other companies that are growing bigger, moving faster, and raising more. The time inside a startup passes the same as the time outside of it, because we are all bound to the same ticking clock. And yet, if you were there, inside of that furious, fitful machine, you would understand. You would know that none of that is true.

I towed a trailer from New York to Austin this week. There was a public service announcement on the highway: “Slow down, you’re in Texas already.”

A good offer, when you’re tired. You’ve been going fast for what feels like forever; the highway goes on forevermore. You can only drive for so long. Eventually, you need something more stable. Eventually, you need to find more solid footing. Eventually, you are excited for a simple [melon party](https://content.severance.wiki/melon_bar) with a few good friends.

It is all a metaphor, of course.

You’ve probably seen [the rumors](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/data-startup-fivetran-talks-buy-dbt-labs-multibillion-dollar-deal) by now. I don’t know if they’re true, and even if they are, deals can always fall apart. The final signature that made [Mode’s sale to ThoughtSpot](https://www.thoughtspot.com/press-releases/thoughtspot-acquires-mode-analytics-for-200m) official came exactly 37 minutes before the press release was published. Startups are more resilient than we often assume, but mergers and acquisitions—those are frail things.

Still, perhaps that will be the conclusion to this story, to this *whole* story: dbt Labs—the startup that defined a minor technological epoch; the one that hammered [its particular will](https://docs.getdbt.com/community/resources/viewpoint) into the professional world; the company around which hundreds more revolved—will end up owned by Fivetran, its long-time sibling.

If it happens, two things are inevitable. First, there will be corporate blog posts about continuity and carrying on. People will be excited to announce that they are joining forces, deepening partnerships, and going further, [together](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/07/30/487925796/it-takes-a-village-to-determine-the-origins-of-an-african-proverb). This is not a new direction, [someone might say](https://mode.com/blog/mode-founders-note-thoughtspot-acquisition#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%20start%20that%20journey%20together%E2%80%94not%20in%20a%20new%20direction%2C%20but%20towards%20a%20bolder%20destination.); this is just a bolder destination.

And second, those posts won’t matter. Fair or not, the tech world will close its book on dbt Labs: $400 million raised, [5,700 customers](https://www.getdbt.com/about-us), somewhere north of $100 million in revenue, and $5 billion exit to a sensible partner.

By all reasonable standards, a huge success, for many people. But nothing is particularly reasonable here, [especially now](https://benn.substack.com/p/enough#:~:text=Which%20one%3F%20I,the%20last%20week.). And Silicon Valley’s scoreboard doesn’t care about absolutes; it cares about derivatives: “We don’t value people by where they are. [We value them](https://benn.substack.com/p/ambition-then-and-now?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=We%20don%E2%80%99t%20value%20people%20by%20where%20they%20are.%20We%20value%20them%20in%20the%20same%20way%20we%20value%20our%20companies%E2%80%94by%20how%20fast%20they%E2%80%99re%20rising.) in the same way we value our companies—by how fast they’re rising.”

Five years ago, the market valued dbt Labs at [only slightly less](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dbt-labs-raises-222m-in-series-d-funding-at-4-2b-valuation-led-by-altimeter-with-participation-from-databricks-and-snowflake-301489733.html)—or, potentially, [slightly more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2022/02/24/dbt-labs-series-d-4-billion-less-than-planned/)—than $5 billion. Snowflake, a close dbt partner, was worth over $100 billion. Venture capitalists said that both companies sat at the center of a [trillion-dollar opportunity](https://benn.substack.com/p/entity-layer?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=When%20Martin%20Casado%2C%20a%20partner%20at%20Andresseen%20Horowitz%2C%20was%20asked%20why%20he%20thought%20the%20data%20industry%20was%20a%20trillion%20dollar%20market%20and%20what%20bets%20he%E2%80%99d%20make%20%5Bupdated%20link%5D%20about%20where%20it%E2%80%99s%20going%2C%20this%20was%20his%20response.), and [dozens of huge companies](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-snowflake-fails?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=%22A%20fuckton%2C%22%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CGo%20build%20a%20%24100%20million%20business.%20It%E2%80%99s%20all%20possible%20for%20everyone%20in%20this%20room.%E2%80%9D%20The%20audience%20applauded.) were left to be built. There was [something in that orange](https://www.getdbt.com/brand-guidelines)—the sort of promise that [happens once every few lifetimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMMUAd66vxo).

Now, the modern data stack is a punchline. The trillion-dollar data market has already been replaced by an AI market that’s [five times as big](https://unctad.org/news/ai-market-projected-hit-48-trillion-2033-emerging-dominant-frontier-technology). Billion-dollar companies [are everywhere](https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/), and [the decacorn is the new unicorn](https://x.com/JenniferHli/status/1965657822387200376). Five billion dollars? Ho-hum.

And so, there will be critics. There will be autopsies. There will be [detached cynicism](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-dbt-fails) and views from nowhere. There will be references to [the line about dying a hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WfRcnF4iZI&t=94s), or living long enough to [become the villain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Bryan#Personal_life)—about dbt Labs drifting away from its core; about the commercialization of a community; about the [perils of venture capital](https://dhh.dk/2013/the-perils-of-mixing-open-source-and-money.html); about consolidation; about the end of an era, or an idea, or an ecosystem.

But there is another, quieter version of the *Batman* quote: *If you live for long enough, nobody is left to give your eulogy*. The people who started the trip with you [get bored](https://benn.substack.com/p/its-time-to-build#:~:text=So%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20time,the%20dark.) or tired or unhappy, and the only records left are feeble photographs and fading memories, and stories that never sound like they felt. And you begin to wonder, [if nobody else remembers it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoDr5g25tk), did it happen? Did it count?

But I was there, for a bit. Many of us were—on the road, in the caravan, some of you were in the car. And though we may now be old and wise—or old and bitter—we were [not always](https://benn.substack.com/p/delirium) that way.

Do you remember it then? Do you remember when [the road felt full of promise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeYSqZPzwr8)? Do you remember how it was before they built what they built?

When I was in school, technology had no particular appeal to me. I ended up here—in Silicon Valley, in data, at Mode—by chance. But once I found myself in San Francisco, I stayed for much longer than I ever meant to. And when my trip with Mode ended, I told its good people why I had stayed:

> At the end of *Charlotte’s Web*, Charlotte the spider says to Wilbur the pig, “You have been my friend. That in itself is a tremendous thing. I wove my webs for you because I liked you.”
> I probably should say that I worked at Mode to accelerate human reasoning, or to make the world a better place, or whatever. And in some loose sense, I guess that’s true—I wanted to make something that mattered, to get rich and famous, and all of that.
> But in reality, I worked at Mode for a more basic reason. I started it with Derek and Josh because I liked them. And I wove my webs here because I liked all of you. For ten years, through disastrous days and calm ones; through good quarters and bad; through layoffs and acquisitions; through highs and lows and the everyday drudgery of corporate administrivia and company building, all of you have been my friends. And no matter what is next, that in itself has been a tremendous thing.

And so it’s been, with my time in this industry, and with many of the people at dbt Labs. No matter what happens next, you have also been my friends. I do not know if that is enough of a narrative for you, but it is enough of a narrative for me.

Next week, I’ll go from Austin to Las Vegas. dbt Labs is hosting their annual conference, and [we have things to share](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/event/21662b38-2c17-4c10-9dd7-964fd652ab44/agenda?session=84fb8dd8-d727-439e-aa4c-195053d12ed2&shareLink=true).

Though I drove here, I will fly there. I made it as far as I could, but could not make it all the way to Las Vegas. It was further than I was able to drive. Like most people, I need a shortcut to the end.

Off the planes, we’ll no doubt whisper about dbt Labs’ future. Is this where their trip ends? There is so much more highway left ahead of them. From Fishtown to Las Vegas—could they make it to LA? Up to Seattle? All the way back to [New York](https://www.nyse.com/ipo-center/filings)?

Maybe; I don’t know. But who are we to judge life on the road when we came here in the air?

There is a Lowe’s distribution center a hundred miles east of Dallas, just off of I-30. Giant letters are [woven](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HMr522ZHQsA8mJY47) into the fence that sits between the facility and the highway: “Who is counting on you to come home safely today?”

When you’re on the highway, it is easy to chase what is in front of us, and forget what—and who—is waiting behind us. It is easy to get absorbed in our ambitions and ourselves, and to forget that [someone wants us home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUwjNBjqR-c). Adventure, for a while. But eventually, a quieter home. A mountain house; a view of the late fragments of sunset light. A small boat and a big lake. A room for movies; a fire place; an ice maker; a nice set of speakers; a few kids running around.

It is an easy exit to miss, on the madness of this highway. But as deserved as it is worthy, if you found it. You can pack a lot of glory into a car, but you cannot fit the good stuff.

# In the air

*Now what?*

This year, there were no venture capitalists.

Often, at tech conferences, there are. They typically drift around as an odd sort of anti-matter, existing among everyone else, but in a different dimension. They are neither practitioners nor prospects, neither speakers nor sponsors. They don’t teach technical workshops, and they definitely don’t *attend* technical workshops.[^1] For most of us, conferences are a place to sell or be sold to, to learn “best practices,” to mischievously order the Macallan 12 at sponsored happy hours, and to gossip. But VCs are there for other reasons, as rogue agents with agendas all their own—to evaluate and to “[diligence](https://www.ft.com/content/8c239cf6-e8e4-11de-a756-00144feab49a),” to [flatter](https://benn.substack.com/p/fear-and-self-loathing-in-silicon?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=After%20the%20last%20pitch%2C%20the%20founders%20and%20investors%20all%20milled%20about%20during%20a%20closing%20happy%20hour.%20A%20robot%20mixed%20cocktails.%20The%20founders%20repeated%20their%20pitches.%20The%20investors%20did%20their%20best%20to%20also%20impress%20the%20founders%2C%20but%20you%20can%20only%20be%20so%20impressive%20with%20a%20backpack%20on.) and to politic, and to astroturf a brand as “one of us.”

People complain about this sometimes. If you are a startup, you can’t relax around a VC—is this conversation a pitch? Could they do our next round? Are they thinking about doing our competitor’s next round?—and you definitely can’t sell to a VC. Too many venture capitalists, people whisper, are bad for the vibes.

But they’re also important representatives of a different vibe: Potential. VCs are moths to a flame: They swarm towards the action; the energy; the chaos; the delirium. They are drawn to the transitional epochs, the moments when the world reinvents itself—when it has let go of one trapeze but not found the next, suspended in the air, with nothing certain to hold on to. They are there, in the beginning.

For years, [Coalesce](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/), dbt Labs’ annual conference and the [closest thing to a center](https://benn.substack.com/p/all-in-one-place) that Silicon Valley’s data ecosystem has, has been that sort of flame. Its hosts were the ringleaders of a booming new circus, and its attendees were starting companies, challenging boundaries, and inventing things. They were, in a niche and indirect way, changing the world.[^2] People talked about the future a lot at Coalesce, and every conversation had an unspoken preamble: That we were the ones creating it. Imagine a world of [consistent metrics](https://benn.substack.com/p/metrics-layer); imagine a world where we can do [math on text](https://benn.substack.com/p/avg-text); imagine a world where we all [share a single corporate brain](https://benn.substack.com/p/entity-layer); imagine a world [without bugs](https://benn.substack.com/p/data-contracts). We were a major prong that was [pushing on the edge](https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/) of what was possible, and VCs [wanted](https://benn.substack.com/p/entity-layer#:~:text=When%20Martin%20Casado%2C%20a%20partner%20at%20Andresseen%20Horowitz%2C%20was%20asked%20why%20he%20thought%20the%20data%20industry%20was%20a%20trillion%20dollar%20market%20and%20what%20bets%20he%E2%80%99d%20make%20%5Bupdated%20link%5D%20about%20where%20it%E2%80%99s%20going%2C%20this%20was%20his%20response) a [piece](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-snowflake-fails#:~:text=%22A%20fuckton%2C%22%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CGo%20build%20a%20%24100%20million%20business.%20It%E2%80%99s%20all%20possible%20for%20everyone%20in%20this%20room.%E2%80%9D%20The%20audience%20applauded) of the heat.

But [the weather in Las Vegas](https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/nv/north-las-vegas/KVGT/date/2025-10-15) was cooler [this year](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/coalesce-2025-rewriting-the-future). The [usual](https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/nv/north-las-vegas/KVGT/date/2024-10-8) scorching [temperatures](https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/nv/north-las-vegas/KVGT/date/2022-6-15) from [data](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/coalesce-2024-highlights) conferences [past](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-to-bring-together-the-world-of-data-collaboration-at-snowflake-summit-2022-live-in-las-vegas/) were gone. There were more pronunciations [about ends](https://x.com/mattturck/status/1977787882946388144) than beginnings.

Eulogies feel too blunt—there are still things to do and to talk about, like the unappreciated lessons behind dbt Labs’ success, or what might happen after this week’s merger, or how everything could contort itself again. But these questions have become more insular. They are a community’s local curiosities. They are interesting to us, now, but they are, apparently, no longer interesting to venture capitalists.

[Las Vegas, so nice we did it twice.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremytcohen/)

Or thrice. Or a half dozen times, if you’ve been involved in this industry for the last few years. And when you come to Vegas enough, you begin retracing your steps. You remember standing at this bar; pacing that promenade; sitting on the floor in that corner. You notice when they update the carpet in the vendor hall. You’re pretty sure that’s the same bar where they had the happy hour last year. That’s the table where Wes hit a hard eight. That’s the back hallway in the airport where you negotiated the last terms of the deal; that’s the Starbucks that you went to celebrate [signing the last Docusign](https://benn.substack.com/p/something-in-the-orange#:~:text=The%20final%20signature%20that%20made%20Mode%E2%80%99s%20sale%20to%20ThoughtSpot%20official%20came%20exactly%2037%20minutes%20before%20the%20press%20release%20was%20published.).

People say that living in college towns can feel like living life on repeat. The same is true of conferences here. New people show up; mainstays leave; *deja vu*; ghosts haunt you in the hallways. Is he here this year? I didn’t expect her to be back. Did we meet last year? Did we meet *at this bar?* It all becomes static—constant motion with no movement.

But that is the point, right? After all, why do we work for startups? Why do we start companies? Why are we drawn to [rocket ships](https://thevcfactory.com/if-youre-offered-a-seat-on-a-rocket-ship-dont-ask-what-seat-sheryl-sandberg/)?

The romantic answer is that we do it for the ride. It is to [go fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qJGsSuFRIg). To go cruising, to entertain ourselves; [to speed so fast, we feel we were drunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLfH9HSUyf4). It’s to live in the center of the universe, where the plasma is still hot, and where there is more potential than permanence.

The other answer is we want to ride the rocket ship to a particular destination—[to find work and get promoted; to buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLfH9HSUyf4). To buy business class tickets, to escape the turbulence, and to reach a smooth cruising altitude. In other words, permanence is the point: Make a thing, sell a thing, and disappear into the mountains. Or, less dramatically, get a job as a Senior Vice President of Enterprise Data Platforms, E-Commerce Cloud.

That’s the catch-22 of Silicon Valley, and of the thrill of potential: You can only keep it so long as you don’t realize it. With a few rare exceptions, you can be comfortably rich or you can be culturally relevant. You can work on critical global plumbing, or you can be inventing new toys. You can matter to the frenetic zeitgeist of Hacker News, or you can grow up.

On the south end of the Las Vegas strip, [very rich men](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/ORCL:NYSE?window=MAX) in [blue shirts and plaid blazers](https://www.oracle.com/ai-world/) were giving keynotes about [how Oracle Applications are](https://www.oracle.com/ai-world/#:~:text=The%20AI%20revolution,speed%20your%20success.) “transforming workflows and business processes to speed your success.” I spotted a couple of their attendees who had wandered north near us, walking through the casino floor with branded backpacks and blaring lanyards. They were out of place, talking in corporate acronyms I didn’t understand, and, by all appearances, having a rather good time.

That is the question now, I suppose. Oracle is among the most successful companies in the world, and the people in its orbit are among the tech industry’s most quietly important operators. If all goes well—historically well—in our world, we can become them. Coalesce is potential, realizing itself. They are potential, fully realized.

Is that what we want? Is that who we want to be? Is that the ambition?

The collective effort of a generous community has granted us a great privilege: We can stay here forever. This industry will exist[^3] longer than we will; our career ladders extend higher than most of us can climb.[^4] We have [more data, more problems](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewbanin/), and more to do. We can get away with hosting conferences that are more [high-wire demos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliasdefaria/) than scripted “fireside chats” from high-paying customers. We can keep building the invisible infrastructure of modern society, and log off when the sun sets and it’s time to go home.

But if we want to live in the spotlight—on the wild edge of possibility, with the frontiersmen—that is no longer here. That is elsewhere, at different companies, in different conference halls, with different people. We are the settlers now; the townspeople; the ones with the family and kids. We can [write the case studies](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristanhandy) about history, but not the dispatches from the front. Those, we will be told about, after they happen.

When I boarded my flight out of Vegas last night, the man sitting by the window had already taken residence in his seat. He was wearing AirPods, Lululemon joggers, and Nike Flyknits. [His window shade was closed.](https://benn.substack.com/p/open-the-window) Throughout our taxi, our takeoff directly over the Las Vegas strip, our tear across the American West and into a Pennsylvania sunrise, and our slip into the dawn over Manhattan, his window shade remained closed.

I spent the entire flight mad, bitter about the adventure on the other side of the shade that I was missing. He spent the entire flight sleeping peacefully.

There is one other thing: When I first found dbt, I was a pessimist. We had built our own transformation tool called [easybake](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/webapp.dimension_query_runs.yml), and liked my version better than theirs. I thought their ref functions were overly complicated; [I didn’t have the emotional octave](https://benn.substack.com/p/delirium?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=That%20vibe%2C%20if,full%20emotional%20range.) for their community Slack.

As I was slowly proved wrong, we all found our roles over the years—the quiet builders, the cheerleaders, the genuine enthusiasts, the opportunistic bandwagoners. The organizers and the leaders. The optimists; the critics, the skeptics, the haters.

Once you see these personas and see who occupies each character, you could not help but notice something else this week: In the end, it was the optimists who were on stage. It is not those who wondered about [how it might fail](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-dbt-fails), but those who believed [the crazy stunts might just work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gracegoheen/). They are the ones who survive, because when everyone [stands up to do the wave](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bolaji/), you can only scowl at it for so long. 

[No matter](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-past-is-not-precious). It is never too late. All life is is whatever’s ahead, and [we are supposed to sing or to dance](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8587787-we-thought-of-life-by-analogy-with-a-journey-a) while the [music is being played](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQS3JGqx46U), be it in this neighborhood that once was, or in the next neighborhood that is just becoming.

[^1]: Yes, I understand that *you *attend the technical workshops. *You* still read ArXiv; you aren’t like the other VCs; you are an operator—no, a builder—at heart. I’m talking about everyone else.

[^2]: Did git change the world?Ten percent of you are probably insulted by the question. *Of course* git changed the world. You have always thought this; you have evangelized this; you are mad that nobody else appreciates this. git made collaborative software development possible. It made large-scale open source projects possible, and the world is run on large scale open-source projects. It is the printing press of the computing age. To imagine a world without git is to imagine a world where every building is built by one person.Another forty percent of you are probably thinking, “huh, ok, maybe git *did* change the world.” You’ve always thought of git as a useful nuisance, a series of incantations that, when recited correctly, do the same thing as uploading a file to Dropbox, and when recited incorrectly, require you to throw away your work, throw away your computer, throw away your career, move to Montana, become a ranch hand, eat only the potatoes you grow and the cattle you raise, and to only think about upstream conflicts when you stare, through squinted eyes across a sun-scorched creek bed, at two fighting coyotes.And fifty percent of you are probably asking, what is git? (For those of you who are asking this, it is a very rigorous and pedantic way to track changes in text files. But rather than just telling you when things change, it instead creates branching tributaries of divergent timelines, which [inevitably intersect in paradoxical ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_paradox), and [eventually implode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3pk_TBkihU).)In any case, there is certainly a case to be made for the first argument. If nothing else, git completely changed the economic structure of software development. It makes updating software less brittle and more reliable, and it makes it easier for engineers to work together. Engineers are more productive, and the software we all use is better, because of git. Many hands make light work, and git made it possible to build software with many hands.It is conceivable that you could make a similar argument about dbt, which has changed how data teams work together. If data is important—which, [you know](https://benn.substack.com/p/disband-the-analytics-team)—then perhaps all of this did change the world.

*[Isn’t it obvious?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmLnKnNh2ns)*

I sometimes wonder if it’s all Slack’s fault.

In 2012, before Slack existed, I worked for a [would-be Slack competitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXKSp4_yKWM). We sold software in the way that was [trendy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) at the time: People bought licenses to use it. [Pay us $15](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-slashes-prices-on-yammer-2012-11#:~:text=It%20used%20to%20cost%20five%20times%20that%E2%80%94%2415%20per%20user%20a%20month.), and one person can use it for a month. Pay us $30, and two people can. Pay us $15,000, and a thousand people can.[^1] And just as a landlord doesn’t care how much time someone spends in their apartment every month, we didn’t care what people did with our software, or if they even logged into it all.[^2] In both cases, customers buy timed access. What they did with that access was irrelevant.

When Slack launched, they charged their customers in the same way. According to their [first pricing page](https://web.archive.org/web/20140713151221/https://slack.com/pricing), “adding or removing team members during the term of a subscription will cause a one-time pro-rated credit or charge on your account.” But then, Slack blew up. The product—and [this chart](https://share.google/images/UGPzVP5U3wZLNv4wF)—was suddenly everywhere. And Slack, with their “be kind” brand and CrayolaCore aesthetic, decided that [this old pricing model was capital-w Wrong](https://web.archive.org/web/20150824215548/https://slack.com/pricing):

> Most enterprise software pricing is designed to charge you per user regardless of how many people on your team are actively using the software. If you buy 1,000 seats but only use 100, you still get charged for 1,000. We don’t think that’s fair. And it’s also hard to predict how many seats you’ll need in advance.
> At Slack, you only get billed for what you use. So you don’t pay for the users that aren’t using Slack. And if someone you’ve already paid for becomes inactive, we’ll even add a pro-rated credit to your account for the unused time. Fair’s fair.

It was a savvy maneuver, for Slack. People were quickly becoming addicted to their product, and it’s unlikely that many of their customers were buying 1,000 licenses and only using 100. Instead, they probably had the opposite problem: More people wanted to use Slack than companies’ IT departments were willing to initially pay for. By charging for only the licenses that people used, Slack could tell those IT departments that they didn’t need to worry about overspending on Slack, because they *couldn’t* overspend on Slack. If nobody liked it, then they would stop logging into it and nobody would get charged for anything. And if lots of people liked it and used it all the time, wasn’t that worth a few dollars a month?

It was an ethos that ate the internet. Silicon Valley is an industry of trends, and Slack was our generation’s trendsetter. Shortly after they launched their “[Fair Billing Policy](https://slack.com/help/articles/218915077-Slacks-Fair-Billing-Policy),” other startups launched their own imitations. At Mode, our customers, many of whom had recently bought Slack, started to ask for the same thing. “Why should I get billed for something if I didn’t want to use it that month?” people said, for the first time. “That’s not how this should work,” they said of how it always worked.

Software pricing is like that though. When you’re selling virtual ephemera on the internet, there is no obvious way to buy it, and there are no physical or economic laws for how it should work. Instead, it’s almost entirely driven by norms and market expectations:

These trends were especially apparent in data products. People [used to buy databases](https://www.teradata.com/blogs/teradata-jumps-ahead-flexible-licensing-choices-change-everything#:~:text=Teradata%20has%20moved%20from%20the%20high%20up%2Dfront%20cost%20of%20perpetual%20licenses%20to%20the%20lower%20up%2Dfront%20and%20more%20predictable%20subscription%2Dbased%20licenses) via perpetual licenses that they paid for once and could use forever. Then, Amazon launched Redshift, which was offered as [a monthly lease](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/11/28/announcing-amazon-redshift/) of a dedicated database. Snowflake shortened the term of the lease—instead of renting a database for a month at time, [you leased it by the minute](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20value,is%2C%2060%20seconds).).[^3] BigQuery then [began charging by query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing?hl=en#analysis_pricing_models), billing customers for every byte they asked BigQuery to process.

At first glance, these steps seem like a refinement of the former model. Each progression adds [smaller intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum) under the demand curve. Pay for exactly what you use—it is pure; efficient; the markets, [clearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_clearing).

Which, maybe; I don’t know; [sir, this is a Substack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONn7lNA89wU), not an NBER paper. But if you spend some time selling all this virtual ephemera on the internet, you’ll probably discover at least one thing: Regardless of the economic theory of each pricing model, there is a *psychological* discontinuity between model three and model four. In the first three models, it is hard to reason about *how much* some software service should cost. What is the right price for a license to use Slack? What is a Google Docs subscription worth? How do I put a price on Spotify? These are esoteric, almost philosophical questions. What is the value of corporate communication? Of an infinite library of documents? Of listening to Gracie Abrams[^4] on a loop for a month?[^5]

We don’t know, so we price software via dead reckoning: What’s fair today is what was fair yesterday. Outlook cost [$12.50 a month](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-office-365-more-new-packages-and-prices-coming-in-november/#:~:text=Office%20365%20Small%20Business%20Premium%20will%20cost%20%2412.50%20per%20month%2C%20or%20%24150%20per%20user%2C%20per%20year.), so Yammer cost $15 a month, so Slack cost [$12.50 a month](https://web.archive.org/web/20140713151221/https://slack.com/pricing).[^6]

But in the fourth model, this breaks down. When you’re selling a single unit of consumption, *people seem much less willing to accept an arbitrary price.* And they start asking one question in particular: “How much does this thing I’m buying cost *you*?”

Consider: A customer could say to Slack, “It costs you a few cents to add another person to your user database and to store the thousand messages that they send every month. Why are you charging me $12.50 for that?” Historically, people don’t ask that though—or at least, don’t complain about it too much—because that’s not how the world works. Arbitrary monthly licensing fees might not be an economically precise pricing model, but, when everyone is used to paying them, it’s a psychologically durable one. But if Slack started charging per message sent, people would start talking about the egregious markup. “It costs Slack a fraction of a penny to send a message, and they’re charging a full penny for it!” There would be righteous online riots about price gouging.

There is nuance here though. If Slack charged incremental fees for storing files, there would be probably be protests, but tamer ones. Because, again, we’re used to that. Storage is a thing we long thought of a scarce resource; we’ve still [pay more for computers](https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/) with more memory; conceptually, storage feels like a fair expense.

We saw all of these dynamics at Mode. When we charged a monthly licensing fee, our first price was $250 for technical users. People were upset by that—not because of the titanic markup we charged on top of a website that cost pennies to provide to an additional user, but because $250 a month for SaaS software was abnormally high. We eventually changed our prices to about $25 for all users. Then, when we added a fee of a few cents to run an additional query—running a query was our equivalent of sending a message on Slack, and also cost us a fraction of a penny—people were outraged by our brazen margins. But later, when we added computational middleware—“an in-memory compute engine”—that made running queries a plausibly expensive operation for us to perform, people still objected, but most customers were ultimately ok with it.

And that’s the lesson, I’d argue. If you can sell subscriptions to your software, you won’t get asked about margins, but you only have so much flexibility about what you can charge. And if you sell consumption, you better charge for something that [sounds expensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mY5FNRh0h4&t=32s). Storing stuff works. Doing a bunch of hard math works. Generating an AI image works. But rendering a website, or calling an API, or managing a database of files and messages—well, “we don’t think that’s fair.”

This is why dbt Labs has always been a fascinating company to me ([and why it will be good for that HBS case](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-dbt-fails#:~:text=In%20the%20data%20industry%2C%20no%20company%20is%20more%20likely%20to%20end%20up%20in%20an%20HBS%20classroom%20than%20dbt%20Labs.)). Because, stylistically, here is the position that it’s always been in:

It’s a very unique set of rocks and hard places: A popular product, without no obvious way to sell it. And for years, [I assumed the way out](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-dbt-succeeds) was for dbt Labs to attach itself—via acquisition or a series of white-labeled OEM deals—to the databases that had more direct ways to make money from people using dbt:

> Databricks solves the riddle of dbt Labs’ business model. Databricks can offer dbt as a free, unmetered service. It wouldn’t care if you use the open-source version or dbt Cloud, nor would it worry about how many seat licenses you buy. This frees up dbt Labs to focus on what it does best—driving adoption of dbt’s core services.

It’s an obvious solution: if you can’t monetize your own service, find someone who can, and get a shared bank account.

Of course, when it happened, people also said that combining [dbt with Fivetran](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-labs-and-fivetran-merge-announcement) was obvious. It was peanut butter and jelly. It was [one-third](https://www.getdbt.com/) and [two-thirds](https://www.fivetran.com/) of a [three-letter acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load). It just made sense.

Spiritually, absolutely; both companies are from the same generation; of the same religion; they went to the same high school. Logistically, as a merger to make a one-stop shop for data services—the Atlassian for Open Data Infrastructure, the Adobe for data people, the [Bean Counter Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html)—I can see that too. Financially, as a way to combine two IPO-ish scale balance sheets into one; makes sense. Defensively, as a means for creating a business big enough to stand its ground against empire-building companies like Databricks and Snowflake; sure, why not?

But, as a solution to the pricing problem—the core dbt problem—that story seems harder to tell. Fivetran can’t make money off of the queries that dbt generates, nor can dbt transform their popularity into more volume for Fivetran. The two businesses are loosely synergistic: They indirectly help one another by, because Fivetran brings more raw data to dbt and dbt makes Fivetran’s raw data more useful, but that was true when they were independent.

Which doesn’t mean the deal *doesn’t* make sense—those other benefits are there, and it gives both companies one less potential competitor in a [compacting industry](https://benn.substack.com/p/category-collapse). Still, it’s not quite 1+1=3, and M&A bankers [love 1+1=3](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-17/exxon-mobil-s-formula-for-m-a-success-1-1-3).

There are a couple obvious options though. One is for the combined company to use its weight and position as the data department store [to become the bully in the industry](https://ethanding.substack.com/p/fivetran-and-dbt-gear-up-for-war):

> fivetran and dbt, the two largest players outside the data warehouses, are merging to flip the script: move value capture back into business logic. what is business logic? it’s the finite set of if/else statements that define your business. sql pipelines are endless conditionals that say “if customer did x, then calculate y, and route to z.” those transformations, rules, definitions of what revenue means and who counts as an active user and how to segment customers - that’s your actual business encoded in code. …
> [Snowflake and Databricks convinced everyone] that compute should capture all value, that business logic should be free. … by merging, [Fivetran and dbt Labs are] trying to have more firepower to make compute cheap and commoditized, and move value capture back where it belongs: business logic.

I guess it could work? But, this doesn’t solve the psychological issue: What, exactly, does dbt charge *for*? You can’t bill for lines of business logic written. I suppose you could charge for a giant platform license—but that is the way we sold software decades ago. The trend is towards charging for consumption, and databases *feel* like they have more right to charge for that than SaaS applications that use databases.[^7]

A second option is for dbt and Fivetran to [fill in the hole in diagram](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-labs-and-fivetran-merge-announcement#:~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20what%20it%20looks%20like%20when%20both%20products%20come%20together%3A), and become a database. Which, also, could work too? But that’s a big risk. Snowflake and Databricks aren’t huge companies because they figured out that there is money in building a giant enterprise database; everyone has know that for decades. They’re huge because they actually pulled off the very difficult thing of building a giant enterprise database. There is a big difference between a clever idea and a *hard* idea, and building a database is very much a hard idea.

Still, perhaps there is a third option—stolen, in true Silicon Valley fashion, from our latest trendsetter.

Here is one way to think about how Cursor works:

The analogy is obvious. Cursor is to Anthropic as dbt is to a database. dbt is the interface; the database “does the work.” dbt has people’s attention; the database gets the money.[^8] And—most notably—[most of the queries that people run are small](https://motherduck.com/blog/big-data-is-dead/), and don’t require giant databases to execute.

So, you know. Put a database underneath dbt Fusion. But a small one; one that’s not about *competing* with Databricks and Snowflake, but about saving customers’ money by choosing more efficient ways to run queries. It’s about doing what’s more efficient. It’s about Fair Pricing.

If only there was a company that was about [Small Data](https://www.smalldatasf.com/).[^9]

[^1]: Well, no, that’s not quite right. Most SaaS software vendors offer discounts if you buy in bulk, so if you paid us $15,000 a month, you’d probably get something like 1,500 licenses. And if you paid us enough—say, $100,000 a month—we’d probably give you an unlimited number of licenses.

[^2]: That’s not quite right either. We also cared a lot about how much people used a product, but it wasn’t because we charged for usage; it was because unused licenses were unlikely to get renewed. If we sold 1,000 licenses and only 100 people used it, most customers (though not all! You’d be surprised!) would notice that, and wouldn’t buy 1,000 licenses again next month or year. And the [entire economic apparatus](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-software-companies-actually-have?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=The%20conventional%20view,significant%20operating%20leverage.) of a SaaS business depends on customers buying *more* services every year, not less.

[^3]: Strictly speaking, Snowflake doesn’t charge for consumption. They charge for the amount of time you keep the database active; what you do while it’s active doesn’t matter. It’s similar to Slack in this regard—they refined the terms of the subscription, but didn’t charge for actual activity.

[^4]: [Has everyone always known this????](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracie_Abrams#:~:text=The%20daughter%20of%20the%20director%20J.%20J.%20Abrams)

[^5]: [Duuuu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX3bN5YeiQs)…[dun](https://www.spotify.com/us/wrapped/).

[^6]: How philosophical is SaaS pricing? [Slack’s guide to understanding the value of Slack](https://slack.com/resources/slack-for-admins/unlocking-value-with-slack) includes the following phrases:“What is value…?”“...a value-centric partnership…”“...we have a dedicated Value Realization team…”“...the Slack Value Realization methodology…”“Build a value map”“...value stories…”“...value strategy…”“Start your journey toward becoming a value expert”And, in a telling coincidence, after all of that, uh, rigorous study, Slack found that the correct price of their revolutionary new communication platform was…exactly the same as as what their older competitors charged.

[^7]: Making compute a faceless commodity doesn’t really solve this either. All that does is drive the margins out of the database; it’s not clear that it pushes those margins back into the software that’s on top. “We own more of the pie by shrinking everyone else’s slices of pie” is great for customers, but not so great for anyone with pie.

[^8]: Cursor charged their customers and then paid Anthropic to execute their requests, whereas dbt connects to customers’ databases, who then bill customers directly for dbt’s usage of the database. The result is the same though; the money ends up with Anthropic and the database, not with Cursor or dbt Labs.

[^9]: An [idea](https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-motherduck/) and an [analogy](https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-cursor/) that [is](https://a16z.com/announcement/fivetran/), also, [obvious](https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-fishtown-analytics-the-makers-of-dbt/).

![Minority Report' Review: 2002 Movie](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tLIR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91854e86-ad60-4dc6-a6e0-e3b20aae47b0_1296x730.jpeg)

Have you ever seen *Minority Report*? Do you remember [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Raqx9sFbo), where Tom Cruise uses a pair of gloves to flip through a bunch of videos on a giant screen? When you first saw it, did you think that it looked cool? Did you want to use a computer like that? Did you ever think, I don’t care what I’m trying to do—he’s solving murders before the victims are dead; I’m mostly responding to emails long after they matter—but I bet it’d be pretty fun to do it with controllers attached to my hands?

Have you ever driven a sports car? Have you ever borrowed [your uncle’s BMW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2jbR0uF7zY), taken a turn faster than you would in your Toyota, and been startled by how precisely it angles through the bend? By how firm it feels on the road? By how easily it finds its pace? Have you ever thought, I don’t have anything practical to do with this car, but if it were mine, I’d look for an excuse to drive it?

Have you ever shot a gun? Even if they aren’t your thing—and [they aren’t mine](https://www.tiktok.com/@tonystatovci/video/7253231136703483182?lang=en)—did their appeal start to make sense? Was there something stupefying in its weight and heavy trigger, and then, all at once, its sound, its recoil, and its explosive hammer? Did you find something electric in it? Not in any practical problem that it might solve or in its alleged everyday utility, but in its awful, intoxicating power?

Most software is not like that. We might say it’s magical; we might describe it as delightful; but, come on. We usually say that because we have something to sell—the product itself, or our taste in it. The only emotion that software typically evokes is slow-simmering frustration; the best software often—aspirationally!—evokes nothing at all. One of Fivetran’s core product principles is to [set it and forget it](https://fivetran.com/docs/core-concepts/product-principles). Google Chrome was built to [get out of your way](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html#:~:text=It%20gets%20out%20of%20your%20way%20and%20gets%20you%20where%20you%20want%20to%20go.). Those are often our highest ideals: To be efficient, to “just work,” to “help us get back to the things we really care about.”

But, occasionally, we stumble across something different.

It was not a car, or a gun, or a personal IMAX mind-melded to the FBI’s Eye of Sauron, but I still remember the first time that I wrote a script that scraped stuff from the internet.[^1] I wanted some numbers from YouTube, they were available in a chart under each video, and I didn’t want to write them all down by hand. So, I wrote a short program to collect them for me. Eventually, my cryptic incantation somehow worked, and the terminal ticked through a series of confirmations:[^2] “*Getting videos…* *Found 57 videos*. *Retrieving video 1…* *Done. Retrieving video 2… Done. …*”

It was, of course, an unremarkable piece of technology. A [popular website](https://www.amazon.com/) could retrieve an obscure object from a distant warehouse and physically deliver it to your door in under 24 hours; all I was asking a computer to do was copy a few dozen numbers from the internet and paste them into a file. Still, that is what made it striking. Amazon’s operations are impossible to comprehend; my script was practically mechanical. You could see its individual pieces; you could see its incessant digital hands and its relentless energy; you could see the impossible infallibility of its math.

And, there was the rote work that I did, and then, the work that *it* did. Yes, that work was dumb, but when we use a computer to do something important, it’s too easy to get distracted by the destination. How fast can I create this document? How efficiently can I file these expenses? How well does it do this Job To Be Done? Can the car haul enough groceries? Does the automated drone have tactical practicality? When there is a [worldwide network of abstract magic](https://x.com/localbateman/status/1969280614055755938) behind a computer, we [forget to be amazed by it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me4BZBsHwZs).

But, up close, there is something mesmerizing about watching [a machine do its simple work](https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/).

Here’s a question, [while](https://benn.substack.com/p/an-very-obvious-deal) [we’re](https://benn.substack.com/p/in-the-air) [here](https://benn.substack.com/p/something-in-the-orange): What if dbt had launched itself with a UI?

For years, dbt’s only interface was the command line. You told it what to do, and, like my old Python scripts, it would slowly print out its progress. That was it—there was no webpage for running dbt; there wasn’t even a way to interact with it using buttons or a mouse. And when it was put on the internet, dbt’s first UI was, for the most part, still [a command line and some logs](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/introducing-dbt-cloud).

But suppose there had been more. Suppose the first version of dbt had included everything that was there, *plus *an interface for dragging and dropping models together [on a visual canvas](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-canvas-is-ga). And suppose that nothing else had been different: dbt Core was developed at the same pace, with the same functionality. Would it have been more successful? *Less* successful?

One answer is that it would’ve been better, because [more is always better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_(economics)#:~:text=Non%2Dsatiation%20refers,diminishing%20marginal%20utility.). Another answer is that it would’ve been worse, because dbt’s limited interface taught data analysts technical skills. For many analysts, dbt was a gateway: Learn dbt; learn how to stumble around the command line; learn foundational engineering tools like git; learn how to write a bit of code, how to write your own scripts, and, eventually, how to do a lot more with a computer than you otherwise could. A UI would’ve shortcut that, and given training wheels to a profession that needed to learn how to ride a bike.

But a third answer is that it would’ve been worse because *the command line tool was a big part of dbt’s appeal*. It was a gateway, though not for practical skills; it was a gateway to the same oddly evocative experience[^3] that I stumbled into when I was trying to scrape YouTube. It was thousands of people’s first glimpse into the guts of their computer, and its arithmetic power. After a lifetime of pointing and clicking, it was the first time we fully commanded a computer with a keyboard and all ten of our fingers. After waiting for websites to load behind a bunch of spinners, we saw how quickly a computer could respond when you removed ads, pictures, and a quarter-million lines of javascript.[^4] It was our first version of Tom Cruise’s gloves, and our first computational sports car. And it was our first time directly holding a gun, [with the safety off](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1cjn8am/i_deleted_data_for_the_prod_table_instead_of).

It was not perfect, of course. Analog tools can be frustrating, and we all had our protective checklists.[^5] But there was something mesmerizing in it too.

[For reasons](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/event/21662b38-2c17-4c10-9dd7-964fd652ab44/agenda?session=84fb8dd8-d727-439e-aa4c-195053d12ed2&shareLink=true), I’ve spent a lot of time in two products over the last couple months: [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-quick-tour), Snowflake’s built-in query and visualization tool; and terminal-based coding apps like [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) and [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli).

If you use these tools, you will notice two things. First, the terminal apps are extraordinarily basic. Their interfaces are text, displayed in bulleted lists and a monospaced font. The text is usually white; occasionally, it’s off-white. Sometimes, the text is in a box. You navigate the app with arrow keys. You cannot use a mouse. Anthropic’s and OpenAI’s frontier models—the most advanced programs that humans have ever created—sit behind these apps, but the apps themselves could be rendered by a [dot matrix printer](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/V-WAnJAezXI).

The [Snowsight UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGLsIVunNVQ) could not be more different. There are tabs and dynamic panels; there are buttons and hover states and user preferences. There are loading states; empty states; overflow states. There is a left-side navigation menu that animates as it slides open, and animates again as the menu’s contents unfurl. And there is AI too: When you click into the query editor, a blue [sparkle](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-sparkles-icon-problem/) pulses twice; click on that button, and a chat dialogue appears—a chat dialogue that, roughly speaking, contains almost the entirety of Claude Code’s UI.

But the second thing you will notice—or at least, the second thing that I noticed—is, when bouncing between Claude Code and Snowflake, you prefer Claude Code. That could be a basic point about clutter and product bloat, though that seems like a lazy criticism: Snowflake’s editor, by most reasonable measures, a well-composed piece of software. It is also the child of two startups that were hallmarks of [technical taste](https://streamlit.io/) and [modern software design](https://x.com/numeracyco).

Still, it is Claude Code—the [Brother WP-80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRLy4VqKGiM)—that feels modern. Most reviews of Claude Code say that’s because of what it *does,* and that it’s good despite its raw interface. “Ironically, its simplicity contributes significantly to its charm,” [said one post](https://rafaelquintanilha.com/is-claude-code-worth-the-hype-or-just-expensive-vibe-coding/); “A terminal interface for chat-based code editing? Sounds like a step backward. But Anthropic did a decent job with it,” [said another](https://www.builder.io/blog/claude-code). Maybe that’s true; maybe for proper engineers, terminal interfaces are outdated anachronisms, an unnecessarily uncomfortable Jeep Wrangler in a world with Waymos and Teslas.

I’m not so sure though. Because, for all the comforts that come with [driving a sofa down the highway](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/lexus/ls/photos-interior?img_name=2023-lexus-ls-7-custom), luxury is rarely an emotional experience. We are not moved by detachment. Tools like Claude Code puts you as close to the technology as it can. Though it only exists on a screen, it is an unexpectedly physical product. Its aesthetic suggests that you’re plugged directly into the mainframe; its snappiness implies that there’s no intermediation. It’s just you and the machine, and the uncanny sense of dexterity that comes with learning how to use it.

Touch grass, they say. Good advice, I suppose, in an [increasingly artificial world](https://openai.com/sora/). But as computers and the internet become ever more unavoidable, I hope that those of us who build them don’t anesthetize them too much. The internet does not need more whiz-bang whirligigs or beautifully efficient minimalism. We can also go the other way, and build stuff that reminds us that computers are physical things too. Because real delight—and productivity, if we must—comes from feeling the machine that we live our lives on, rather than forgetting to see that it exists.
