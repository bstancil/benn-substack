# How much is the news worth?

*If you're OpenAI, it depends on what you’re building—and when you’re asking.*

*[Might be fun to run a newspaper.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKS_fSDP3-E)*

There are two ways to think about ChatGPT. 

One way is that it’s exceptionally good at doing stuff. We give it an instruction, and, because it’s been trained on an enormous corpus of human language, it can respond in a way that would, if anything, fail the Turing test for being *too* capable. In an instant, it can write a [French sonnet](https://chat.openai.com/share/866b981f-ab80-49a0-8b16-624b6c1af99b) about New Year’s Eve; it can create [an argument](https://chat.openai.com/share/12369408-6202-47b4-9b6b-48111bc1505e) for why it should be a felony to write songs in C major; it can [understand](https://chat.openai.com/share/ac023d64-78e1-4a55-aa5c-99b248ad08e8) a 700-word blog post from which all the vowels have been removed. For tasks like these—writing emails, creating lesson plans, [finding and booking a restaurant](https://support.opentable.com/s/article/OpenTable-and-ChatGPT-integration) for a six-person get-together next Friday in New Orleans—ChatGPT is valuable because of what it can *do*.

The second way to think it is that it *knows* things. We ask an LLM like ChatGPT a question; it tell us the answer. It’s valuable because it’s read every encyclopedia and textbook and Reddit post in the world, and can summarize—and in some cases, recreate—what those things say. Though LLMs don’t store this information in a traditional sense—there is no file in GPT-4 that contains the full text of the Declaration of Independence, for example—ChatGPT can still [rewrite the entire document](https://chat.openai.com/share/ce06de41-882d-4f01-8d1c-b5a1151cb56b). In this way, LLMs aren’t useful because of what they can do, but because of what they know—like [who Calvin’s babysitter was](https://chat.openai.com/share/63d921a0-b559-4d6a-9e83-500d8d50877d), [who scored the most points](https://chat.openai.com/share/ff6afad7-355c-4de0-8e7a-a725f61cf9dc) in a WNBA game, and [which song starts](https://chat.openai.com/share/920e2344-088f-49b4-8c7c-47fce81b2a8c) with the notes “da da da dum.” 

This second version of ChatGPT—the one that, above all, *knows* things—is the version that caused people to [declare Google dead](https://twitter.com/jdjkelly/status/1598021488795586561), and caused [Google to freak out](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/technology/ai-chatgpt-google-search.html), when OpenAI released it. Whereas Google can find links that might answer your questions, ChatGPT answers them directly. Its appeal was as the ultimate [lazyweb](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lazyweb).[^1]

If this is the role that LLMs come to occupy—[Google 2.0](https://talia.gold/2022/10/31/a-trillion-dollar-opportunity/), basically—copyrighted content from books and news publishers is immensely valuable to OpenAI. To replace Google, ChatGPT would need to “know” most of what Google can find—and Google can search the entire internet, including copyrighted websites. Without access to that content, ChatGPT isn’t a better Google; it’s a chatbot for summarizing Wikipedia and Reddit. 

If ChatGPT ultimately occupies the first role—a bot that *does* stuff; an agent—OpenAI doesn’t *need* copyrighted material. An AI agent would be useful for the same reasons that human agent is useful, and human agents are useful because they can complete complex tasks based on ambiguous instructions. They don’t need to *know* that much; they need to be able to communicate, reason about problems,[^2] and look stuff up. And just as a human assistant can be a good assistant without memorizing the script of *Star Wars or *what was said in the *Wall Street Journal* yesterday, an LLM can probably be trained to be a useful agent without being trained on copyrighted content. Give it enough high-quality text, from any source, and it can learn to talk as well as any of us.[^3] 

Despite the initial panic at Google, I’d be surprised if ChatGPT comes for search. Though that’s partially because LLMs aren’t, [on their own](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1733299213503787018), reliable narrators of fact, it’s much more because the economic value of agents that do stuff is potentially far greater than the economic value of a chatbot that knows stuff. “We can help your accountants answer common questions about tax regulations” [is a nice pitch](https://erp.today/pwc-joins-the-ai-trend-with-its-own-chatpwc/), but a fundamentally incremental improvement over Google; “we can create an infinite army of cheap digital labor that can do a lot of the tasks your employees do” is transformative. The frontier of ChatGPT potential isn’t replacing Google, but in *using *Google[^4]—and in the same way that the cost of manual labor made industrialization all but inevitable, the cost of skilled labor probably makes the agentization of [fake email jobs](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fake%20Email%20Job)[^5] all but inevitable too.[^6] 

In other words, for the enhanced search engine that OpenAI is today, copyrighted content is *necessary*. Omniscient oracles need to read the news to be omniscient. But for the autonomous agents they’ll likely become, copyrighted material is simply *convenient*—news websites, for example, are generally reliable, accurate, well-written, constantly produced in large quantities, and can be collected from relatively centralized sources. But any sufficiently diverse body of text will do.

# Regime change

Well, hypothetically. I don’t know if you can actually build ChatGPT without copyrighted content because OpenAI definitely built ChatGPT with copyrighted content. 

Late last month, [the New York Times sued OpenAI](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html) for doing exactly that. [Their case](https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf) alleges that OpenAI violated copyright law by using millions of Times’ articles to train their models without paying proper licensing fees; that this unlicensed use of the Times’ intellectual property allows OpenAI to “compete with and closely mimic” the Times; and that this is providing material economic benefits to OpenAI while causing considerable economic and reputational harm to the Times. The Times “seeks to hold them responsible for the billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages,” and is calling for the destruction of “all GPT or other LLM models and training sets that incorporate Times Works”—which, presumably, includes every publicly-available model created by OpenAI.

Some people [said it’s a dumb and short-sighted move](https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1740570503348433160) by the Times[^7], akin to Blockbuster suing the internet instead of building a streaming service. But that seems to miss the point of the lawsuit: It’s not about futilely trying to hold back the tide of technological progress; it’s about *making money from that tide*.

The Times surely knows they can’t whack-a-mole the generative AI genie back in the bottle. I also doubt that they see generative AI isn’t an immediate threat to journalism itself—LLMs can’t do on-the-ground reporting, and the early efforts to replace writers with AI-powered bots have been [mostly](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/30/tech/gannett-ai-experiment-paused/index.html) [disastrous](https://futurism.com/sports-illustrated-ai-generated-writers). Instead, generative AI is a potential threat to the journalistic business model. If people can ask for summaries of the news from ChatGPT—if *The Daily* can be recreated by an LLM that ingests yesterday’s news stories and reads you a summary—then, as the suit alleges, OpenAI’s products “undermine and damage The Times’s relationship with its readers and deprive The Times of subscription, licensing, advertising, and affiliate revenue.”

That argument makes for a reasonable lawsuit, but it's probably not the real goal of the lawsuit. As others have said, [Napster is a useful precedent](https://twitter.com/GaryMarcus/status/1741857693420151037). Napster—and the internet more broadly—didn’t replace musical artists; it replaced their methods of distribution. Though the music industry sued Napster out of business, the real importance of the Napster lawsuits was that they eventually helped create a new economic regime that ensured musicians and record labels would still get paid when streaming digital music replaced records and CDs. The New York Times’ lawsuit probably won’t bankrupt OpenAI, but its foundational objective seems the same: To establish an economic and legal precedent that protects publishers if chatbots and LLMs replace search engines as the lobby to the internet, and *still enriches them* if they become trillion-dollar generative AI agents that no longer need the news. 

Suppose, for example, that a very prominent Facebook user sued Facebook by arguing that Facebook was monetizing their labor and illegally withholding compensation for it. That lawsuit would seem ridiculous now, but in 2006, when we were all figuring out what social media was, it could’ve been seen as legitimate. And had the user won, the economics of social media would’ve been redrawn, potentially to a point where today’s model—one in which users *don’t* get paid—would be the one that sounds ridiculous. 

In fifteen years, there will be legal precedents about how generative AI vendors compensate content creators for using their licensed content. There will be norms and expected standards. And, perhaps even more importantly, if generative AI vendors are building agents and not search engines, they *won’t even care* about using licensed content. 

But today, they do care, a lot. Large libraries of high quality text is suddenly very valuable to some very rich people—and the Times has a lot of it. So if you’re the Times, why *not* sue? Not as a defensive move, but because to try to create a new, legally enforceable revenue stream, at a time when you have maximal leverage—your data is still critical, court precedents are still being established, informal norms are in your favor, and the frenzied AI land grab is putting pressure on every vendor to move faster at all costs.[^8] 

In this climate, OpenAI probably can’t risk going to trial. If they lose—and they could; [copyright lawyers have said](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/openai-faces-existential-threat-in-new-york-times-copyright-suit) that OpenAI is “dangerous legal territory”[^9]—it could cost them billions of dollars, require them to destroy models that they’ve spent enormous amounts of time and money building, and spawn dozens more lawsuits from other copyright holders.[^10] Even if they won, a trial could put their development teams in months or years of legal limbo, unsure of what training data they can and can’t use.[^11] 

And for the Times, the worst case is that you lose, pay some legal bills, and go home. The middle case is you force OpenAI to the negotiating table, and settle on a marginally better licensing deal that you [would’ve otherwise gotten](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-offers-publishers-as-little-as-1-million-a-year). And the best case is you use some legal leverage and OpenAI’s paranoia about falling behind in the cutthroat market to secure a long-term precedent that gives you a perpetual piece of the generative AI pie.

Or, if nothing else, you might make a tech executive mad and convince them to [buy you out](https://twitter.com/tszzl/status/1741218820709134555) for a [38 percent premium](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/25/business/elon-musk-twitter?smid=url-copy#musks-deal-for-twitter-is-worth-about-44-billion), I guess.

[^1]: “[Dear lazyweb](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/nyregion/michael-cohen-ai-fake-cases.html), what are some good fake court cases I can use to defend my client who’s been accused of constantly making stuff up?”

[^2]: I understand LLMs can’t reason in a formal sense, but they can create artifacts that are indistinguishable from things that have previously required human reasoning to create.

[^3]: There’s also some evidence that general knowledge makes LLMs more effective assistants than specialized knowledge, [even when they’re asked to do specialized tasks](https://www.latent.space/p/bryan-bischof#:~:text=Why%20do%20we%20need%20such%20a%20general%20model%20for%20writing%20code%2C%20writing%20SQL%2C%20doing%20data%20analysis%3F%20Shouldn%27t%20a%20fine%2Dtuned%20model%20just%20on%20Kaggle%20notebooks%20be%20good%20enough%3F%20I%27d%20argue%20no.).

[^4]: Bing, whatever.

[^5]: This, the [yutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6qGwmXZtsE) tell me, is basically an [office job](https://www.tiktok.com/@mads.ringswaldegan/video/7092055375633206574).

[^6]: Notably, today, LLMs are probably ahead of the world’s ability to use them as these kinds of agents. To adapt [an analogy I’ve used before](https://benn.substack.com/i/99275606/where-were-going-we-dont-need-roads), LLMs are like cars: For them to be maximally useful, you need the car *and* a bunch of roads. Our current LLMs are decent cars, but we have very few roads that are designed for them to drive on. The eventual development of AI agents will depend on our ability to build those roads. But, because the economic benefits of having both are so huge, it’s hard to imagine people not eventually building the roads.

[^7]: Actually, they said that “asking to be deleted from the amortized collective memory compressed in GPT4 weights” is “information theoretic self-immolation,” which, like, sure, to infinity and beyond, man.

[^8]: OpenAI has licensing deals in place with [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-associated-press-ap-f86f84c5bcc2f3b98074b38521f5f75a) and [Axel Springer](https://www.axelspringer.com/en/ax-press-release/axel-springer-and-openai-partner-to-deepen-beneficial-use-of-ai-in-journalism), so there are private precedents that suggest that OpenAI believes that copyright holders will ultimately be entitled to some compensation.I also have so many questions about the terms of these deals. The details of the deal with AP weren’t disclosed; the [Axel Springer deal reportedly](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/business/media/media-openai-chatgpt.html) “includes a ‘performance fee’ based on how much OpenAI uses its content” and “is worth more than $10 million per year.” Is OpenAI paying per article they use to train models? Do they pay for a kind of perpetual license that allows them to use that article as much as they want, or do they pay more if they set higher weights on Axel Springer articles? (One of the arguments in the Times’ lawsuit is that OpenAI sampled the Times’ content more frequently than other sources when they trained their GPT models.) Does OpenAI pay Axel Springer just for access to training data, or do they somehow get paid on inference? How would that even work? And how does Axel Springer have any way to monitor how much OpenAI is actually using their content?

[^9]: I have no idea about the specific legal merits of the Times’ lawsuit, but the basic facts of the case, which nobody seems to dispute, don’t look great for OpenAI? Like:OpenAI scraped millions of New York Times articles without paying for them.Sometimes, OpenAI repeats those articles verbatim.OpenAI is making tons of money by using those articles for commercial use.The New York Times is not.I don’t know anything about the [fair use doctrine](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/30/business/media/copyright-law-ai-media.html), but that seems bad!

[^10]: And maybe even more importantly, it could destroy the experience of using ChatGPT. OpenAI already [appears to be scrambling](https://twitter.com/CeciliaZin/status/1742093352919781448) to prevent their models from creating other copyrighted work. Imagine if these warnings and restrictions were tighter, and every time you asked it to do something that might touch a copyright, it tried to awkwardly steer away from it. It’d be like watching *[Any Given Sunday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday#Principal_photography)* where everything is *supposed* to be the NFL, but nothing actually *is* the NFL.

[^11]: Here’s a fun tin foil hat theory: The case is actually a proxy war between Google and Microsoft, in which the New York Times, [a Google partner](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-times-to-get-around-100-million-from-google-over-three-years-f2dd15e1), sues OpenAI, a *de facto* Microsoft subsidiary, to force them into some sort of legal and technical purgatory to slow them down. Is it true? Probably not; I made it up. But it would make the [inevitable OpenAI movie](https://bgr.com/entertainment/heres-who-id-cast-in-the-inevitable-openai-movie/) even better.

*Carta tries to make an exchange.*

*[so that we may survive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=366DExfdQWM)*

Name this company:

X[^1] runs an internet service that asks people to share a bunch of private information with it. There are lots of ways X might do this: It could help them answer sensitive questions about their health, for example, or it could make it easier for them to manage complex spreadsheets about their finances. Though this sounds like a hard thing to convince people to do—“hi, we’re a new startup, please type your most important secrets into this box”—all it really takes is a [creative design](https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/13/omg-mailbox-is-amazeballs/), a [quirky commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGPqSS7reck), or a [buzzy partnership](https://www.whoop.com/us/en/press-center/official-wearable-crossfit-partnership/), and thousands of people will connect their email accounts, sync their credit card purchases, and stream by-the-minute vital signs directly from their wrists into some anonymous corporate cloud. X did this better than most, and convinced a lot of people to share things with it.

Next, X makes a big show about how much they care about their customer’s privacy. "When you use our services," X might say, "you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control." The assurances work. People feel good about X; X isn’t evil; X is committed to its customers.

But then, after X has collected lots of private data, X sells it. But it doesn’t sell it directly—that would make X seem like a liar, because of everything it said about privacy and trust and responsibility. Selling data might also violate X’s own terms of service, though X is careful about the promises it makes. “We don’t share customers’ personal information without their consent”, its privacy policies could say, “but we do provide that information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons.” 

So, instead of selling data outright, X builds a kind of matchmaking service that allows third parties to transact with its customers. These third parties submit bids to X about the kinds of people they might want to sell something to or buy something from. When X gets a bid, it looks through all the secret information that its customers shared with it—information about their finances, or health, or whatever—to see who might be most interested in what the third party is offering. X sends all of the good matches an enticing email about the third party’s proposal. “We have a firm offer we thought you might like to see,” X tells them. Though X takes a cut of the transaction, it says its goals are more noble than that: It wants to make markets more effective, more efficient, and more useful.

So who is X?

I mean, obviously, it’s Carta, which was the [main character](https://twitter.com/maplecocaine/status/1080665226410889217) in Silicon Valley last week after getting exposed for [running exactly this business](https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-marketing-shares-of-client-companies-without-their-knowledge-2024-1). To quickly recap, Carta is the most popular way for startups to manage their capitalization tables, which are complex—and confidential—legal documents that keep track of who owns company shares and on what terms.[^2] Startups struggle to manage these documents on their own; if you pay Carta a modest annual fee, they’ll do it for you.

The data in these documents, however, represents another opportunity, for both Carta and its customers. The market for startup shares is illiquid and opaque—if you are an investor, it’s difficult to buy shares in hot private companies because there you don’t know who might be selling and at what price; if you’re an employee or an investor that owns shares in a startup, you don’t have an open market to sell them on. As a result, private companies’ shares trade on [decentralized](https://equityzen.com/) [secondary](https://www.nasdaqprivatemarket.com/) [markets](https://forgeglobal.com/) that are more akin to Facebook Marketplace than Fidelity—they’re like auction houses for collectibles, where the marketplace only knows about the occasional shares that are listed on their exchange.

Because of its successful capitalization table business, Carta has access to much more complete market data—they know exactly who owns shares in thousands of startups, and what they paid for them. In theory, they could use that data to create a more efficient marketplace that’s better for everyone—better for buyers, who get more reliable prices; better for sellers, who get easier access to liquidity; and better for Carta, who can take a cut of every transaction. So, [three years ago](https://henrysward.medium.com/finally-a-private-stock-exchange-cartax-3c658f30ac97), Carta created exactly this sort of exchange, under the banner of exactly this sort of mission.

# (Carta)X

This week, almost overnight, Carta [shut it down](https://henrysward.medium.com/should-carta-facilitate-secondary-trading-c319e0c9f080). 

The marketplace, called CartaX, was undone by one bad email exchange. Sometime recently, a third party reached out to Carta to buy shares in [Linear](https://linear.app/), a popular startup that builds issue-tracking software. Linear is (was?) a Carta customer, so Carta looked through Linear’s capitalization table, found some shareholders who might be interested in selling, and sent them an enticing email about the third party’s proposal. “I’m reaching out because we have a firm buy order,” Carta said, “but might be willing to flex higher.” One of those emails was forwarded to Linear’s CEO, who, quite reasonably, [did not like it](https://twitter.com/karrisaarinen/status/1743398553500971331), and posted about it on Twitter and LinkedIn.  

[Silicon Valley went berserk](https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-backlash-silicon-valley-startups-2024-1&post-bottom-piano-recommendations). Part of the problem was about control: Startup boards typically want to approve secondary stock transactions like the one that Carta was trying to facilitate. By directly reaching out to shareholders instead of Linear’s board, Carta was undermining Linear’s ability to control who buys and sells its shares.

The bigger problem, however, was about [trust](https://twitter.com/karrisaarinen/status/1743399936526622971). Carta’s customers trusted it with highly sensitive data, and Carta used it to make money. Even if the Carta’s terms of service technically allow them to do it,[^3] the exchange breaks the spirit of [Carta’s promise](https://carta.com/blog/cartas-operating-principles-and-identity-traits/#:~:text=earn%20our%20customers%E2%80%99%20trust%20through%20every%20decision%20that%20we%20make.) to “earn [their] customers’ trust through every decision that we make.” 

The lesson from all of this, it seems, is the obvious and ethical one: Don’t sell your customers’ secrets! You might get sued! And even if you don’t, people will be very upset, it will go horribly wrong, and you will have to shut down the entire business.  

# X(.company)

Or, you’ll become the [fourth most valuable company in the world](https://companiesmarketcap.com/)? Because X is also Google?[^4] Like:

Google runs a search service that asks people to [share a bunch of private information with it](https://www.amazon.com/Everybody-Lies-Internet-About-Really/dp/0062390856). Google makes a big show about how much they care about their customers’ privacy. "When you use our services," [Google literally says](https://policies.google.com/privacy), "you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control." People [feel good](https://www.forbes.com/powerful-brands/list/) about Google; Google [isn’t evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil); Google says it’s [committed to its customers](https://about.google/commitments/).

But then, after Google collects lots of private data, Google sells it. Not directly—[Google says](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US#infosharing) that it does “not share your personal information” without consent, though it’s careful about the promises that it makes. “We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons,” the privacy policy says.

Instead, Google sells its customers’ data through an advertising auction house that matches third party sellers with Google customers. These third parties submit bids about the kinds of people they might want to sell something to, and Google looks through all the secret information that its customers shared with it to see who might be most interested in what the third party is offering. Google sends all the good matches an ad—and sometimes puts an enticing email [directly in their inbox](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6603?hl=en)—about the third party’s proposal. “We have a firm offer for a deal we thought you might like to see,” Google is basically saying, every time it shows an ad. Though Google takes a cut of the transaction, it says its goals are more noble than that: It wants to make markets [more effective, more efficient, and more useful](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312507084483/dex991.htm#:~:text=less%20intrusive%2C%20more%20effective%2C%20and%20more%20useful.%20Together%20with%20DoubleClick%2C%20Google%20will%20make%20the%20Internet%20more%20efficient%20for%20end%20users).

Of course, some people get upset about Google doing this, and search engines like [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) exist to give people an alternative to Google. But [relatively few people](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/all/united-states-of-america) use DuckDuckGo, and we’ve all kind of collectively accepted that it’s ok for Google, and hundreds of other companies, to sell private information about us on advertising exchanges. 

Is Carta really that different?[^5] Though nobody disputes that Carta was wrong to sell around Linear’s board, why is Google’s matchmaking business seen as a fundamentally legitimate one, and Carta’s [as fundamentally unethical](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/09/carta-unanswered-questions#:~:text=thus%20eliminating%20that%20advantage%20if%20Carta%20was%20acting%20ethically.)? 

Both collect data through a kind of sleight of hand, by providing an adjacent—and independently useful—service that convinces customers to share information with them. Both are marketplaces where those customers remain anonymous to third parties unless the customers opt in to third parties’ proposed transactions. Both exchanges are built on extremely sensitive data, and it’s at least arguable that Google search histories are *more* *sensitive* than capitalization tables.[^6] Both have more information than any one buyer or seller, but there’s not any real evidence that either uses that advantage to front-run trades or manipulate prices.

The difference, it seems, is actually mostly in the optics of how the exchanges are run—and specifically, in the optics of how involved people are in running them. I get a little creeped out when Google serves me a highly-targeted ad about the thing I was just talking about. But I would probably call the FBI if I got an email from Jack Cantwell, Search Client Specialist, saying that he’s been reviewing my internet records and wanted to let me know that he has a firm sell order for two *[Guts World Tour](https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/3B005F2BF2B41D1B) *tickets from a Google client that I might be interested in.[^7] Though *Google the company *is basically doing the exact same thing in both cases, *Jack the person *is not. And when it comes to privacy and trust, we don’t seem to mind putting all of our secrets in some faraway company’s filing cabinets. But we very much mind when someone at that company opens them.

Which makes me wonder—had Carta’s emails been automated notifications about new buy orders, would the story have blown up the way it did? Usually, people like real emails from other people more than they like marketing emails from DoNotReply@buynow.com.[^8] But they probably *don’t *like emails from other people when those emails are about stuff they thought was private. We want those emails to be from machines, sent discreetly and automatically. We want our ads to be delivered to us by an algorithm, not by Jack.

The irony in all of this is that Carta’s emails may well have been exactly that. The personalized touches in most cold outreach emails are [just a sales tactic](https://www.klenty.com/blog/personalized-sales-email-templates/) to hide the fact that they’re automated, templatized to appear handwritten, and sent out by thousands.[^9] The emails Linear’s shareholders got could have been triggered by a bid for shares, generated by some email marketing tool that made them look like they were written by a senior member of the “Investor Coverage Team,” and shotgunned out to the Linear shareholders who were programmatically determined to be likely buyers. Though those emails still would’ve been a mistake—they should’ve gone to Linear’s board, not its shareholders—the issue then would’ve probably been more about how CartaX is careless with customer data, and less about how CartaX is [unethical](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/07/carta-the-cap-table-management-outfit-is-accused-of-unethical-tactics-by-a-customer-after-it-tries-broker-a-deal-for-a-startups-shares-without-consent/) and [shouldn’t exist](https://www.fastcompany.com/91006942/carta-fintech-ethics-breach-venture-capital-svb). But now, because the emails seemed to come from a sales rep prospecting through companies’ capitalization tables looking for deals, [Axios is asking questions](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/09/carta-unanswered-questions) about rogue employees, systemic accessing of cap table information, and investigations and audits. 

For better or for worse, privacy and trust are probably like that. It matters how they look as much as how they work. The difference between Google and Carta may not be so much in how they manage their exchanges, but in how they manage how their appearances. Carta was careless last week, and changed how people saw CartaX because of it. Now, they’re killing CartaX, in hopes of saving how people see Carta.

An eye for an eye. It’s fitting, I guess, that that’s the final exchange on CartaX. It always was about the optics.

# Carta, again

I'm neither qualified nor organized enough to have a list of startup laws, but if I were, the first law would be “your startup won't make it to step two.”

We’ve talked about this a [few](https://benn.substack.com/p/so-you-want-to-sell-to-the-enterprise#:~:text=Ask%20for%20ten%20pitch%20decks%20from%20early%2Dstage%20B2B%20startups%2C%20and%20you%E2%80%99ll%20get%20nine%20versions%20of%20this%20master%20plan%3A) [times](https://benn.substack.com/p/clear-eyes-full-hearts) [before](https://benn.substack.com/p/customer-capture):

> It’s not uncommon, in early stage fundraising decks, for founders to pitch their first product as a stepping stone to a bigger one. We’ll start with building a simple alerting service for monitoring when your brand gets mentioned on social media, they might say, but we’ll use the data we collect to build an AI-powered ad platform. We’ll launch as a data catalog, and use that as a wedge to expand into our true vision as an end-to-end data lifecycle management application. We’ll begin an office leasing agency, but eventually [harness the energy of we to elevate the world’s consciousness](https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-roasted-over-cultish-ipo-filing-2019-8). 

This doesn’t work, I said, because most “companies spend their entire lives trying to finish part one.” The wedge is usually hard enough to build on its own. Step two is often the mirage on the horizon of step one’s infinite desert.

Carta proved the premise wrong—but still proved the theory right? Since its founding in 2013, Carta’s capitalization table product was supposed to step one. “Building the Nasdaq for private markets” [was the real goal](https://henrysward.medium.com/finally-a-private-stock-exchange-cartax-3c658f30ac97), and the marketplace was step two. 

Somewhat remarkably, Carta actually found the end of its desert. They built a capitalization table business that [makes $250 million a year](https://henrysward.medium.com/should-carta-facilitate-secondary-trading-c319e0c9f080#:~:text=the%20captable%20business%20is%20about%20%24250M/year), and is ([was?](https://www.wsj.com/articles/carta-a-key-silicon-valley-player-for-startups-stumbles-prompting-customers-to-consider-competitors-89800bb8)) the clear market leader. They were poised, it seemed, [to make the exchange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6XHLe94SJA).

But step two was undone by step one’s *success*. Though the capitalization table business was a great economic and informational launchpad for the CartaX, it was an anchor for the brand. Customers felt betrayed by the marketplace, because they saw it as a violation of what they believed Carta stood for. And Carta couldn’t trade a $250 million business for a $3 million one—[which was CartaX’s revenue](https://henrysward.medium.com/should-carta-facilitate-secondary-trading-c319e0c9f080#:~:text=the%20secondary%20trading%20business%20is%20about%20%243M)—no matter its potential. For CartaX, the only thing worse than step one failing was step one succeeding. 

For other startups, the lesson, then, is still the same: Don’t plan on making it to step two. If you want to build an exchange, build an exchange. If you want to build a back office capitalization table management business, build a back office capitalization table management business. But if you only want to build the latter so that you can eventually build the former, don’t. Because if you walk through the desert long enough to reach the end of it, you’ll have evolved into something that can only survive in the sand.

[^1]: There are lots of dumb things about Elon Musk renaming Twitter, but one of the more annoying ones is that “X” no longer works a generic variable.

[^2]: In a very simple world, a capitalization table would say something like, Steve Jobs owns 50 percent of Apple, Steve Wozniak owns 25 percent, [Mike Markkula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Markkula) owns 25 percent minus three shares, and [Ronald Wayne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Wayne) owes three shares (bummer). But in reality, capitalization tables are far more confusing than that. Even for small startups, they can contain hundreds of shareholders, multiple classes of shares that all have different voting rights and strike prices, and complex vesting schedules that define when employees have the right to buy shares and which employees have exercised those rights. It’s messy, legally complicated, and, because employees are constantly vesting and exercising shares, very dynamic. Managing all that is hard, and Carta does it all for you. (And, in my experience, does a genuinely good job of it. Mode was a happy Carta customer for years.)

[^3]: I mean, how can Carta not be allowed to do this, their terms of service [don’t even mention Linear](https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1744830917602951407).

[^4]: Well, Google is Google LLC, Google LLC is owned by Alphabet, and X is [x.company](https://x.company/), a division of Google LLC. I don’t know. I’m talking about Google Search.

[^5]: To be clear, my point here isn’t that Google or Carta are either right or wrong. I just find it curious that they’re treated so differently for doing such similar things.

[^6]: If you were a lawyer at SpaceX, which would you pay more to keep private? The full details of SpaceX’s entire cap table, or Elon Musk’s search history? The answer has gotta be the second one.

[^7]: But seriously, Jack, if you’re out there and you do, [email me](https://www.benn.website/).

[^8]: This is not a real email; do not reply to this email.

[^9]: For example, if you’ve get Mode or ThoughtSpot marketing emails, you might get an email from about a [webinar we’re hosting on Tuesday](https://mode.com/content/mode-webinar-data-and-analytics-trends-2024). But it’s a trick! It’s not actually from me!

*[Y’all got this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB2yqeD0Nus)*

From the time that I started this blog in early 2021 through November of 2022, 48 percent of the posts I wrote were about the modern data stack. Ideally, I’d say that those posts were inspired by a passion for modern software, or data technology, or stacks. That I was, [as Richard Feynman advised](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/936-study-hard-what-interests-you-the-most-in-the-most), studying hard what interested me, in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible. That I had other work to do, but for several years, [the only thing I actually wanted to do](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/in-praise-of-uselessness#:~:text=I%20had%20other%20work%20to%20do%2C%20teaching%20and%20editing%20and%2C%20eventually%2C%20working%20as%20a%20magazine%20journalist%2C%20but%20for%20several%20years%2C%20the%20only%20thing%20I%20actually%20wanted%20to%20do%20was%20analyze%20Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer.) was analyze *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* the economic and technical dynamics of cloud-based data tooling startups.

But none of that would be quite true. The real reason I barfed up predictions and complaints about cleverly branded computational corporate middleware every other week for two years was because *other people were doing the same thing*. The ecosystem around the modern data stack was a club, and the club was popular.[^1] The club was full of good gossip.[^2] The club was where people were having fun and getting rich and becoming popular, and I wanted all of those things too.

Today, [as lots of people have noticed](https://mattturck.com/mad2023-part-ii/), that club isn’t what it used to be. On November 30, 2022, ChatGPT came out, Silicon Valley [lost its mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faa2dHJNFqQ), and the tech world’s simmering interest in generative AI became an immediate obsession. The modern data stack—as a [collection of tools](https://www.moderndatastack.xyz/), as a [philosophy](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-new-philosophers#:~:text=it%20represents%20the-,epochal%20sequel,-2), as a [brand](https://www.fivetran.com/blog/5-reasons-to-attend-modern-data-stack-conference-2023), as an [object of interest](https://davidsj.substack.com/p/the-modern-data-stack-is-dead-long) on the internet, as an era of [launches on Product Hunt](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-new-philosophers#footnote-3-113305279)—became the millennial’s Hydro Flask to the [zoomer’s Stanley](https://www.tiktok.com/@victoria_robino_26/video/7318781471873977646): Out of date, and out of demand.

And I, [ever the aimless moth to the brightest light](https://www.tiktok.com/@jessejosephgeneau/video/7324112216775494917), followed the mob. Before November 30, I wrote [one post](https://benn.substack.com/p/all-your-database-are-belong-to-us) about AI. After, I wrote eighteen. In the last thirteen months, 31 percent of this blog has been about AI—and even more tellingly, only 29 percent of it has been about the modern data stack. 

My attention drifted because I, like a lot of the people who were at this party, was never fully here for [the right reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRyNzYPASoA). I wasn't here to [find true love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRyNzYPASoA&t=27s) in directed acyclic graphs or data observability; the modern data stack was never the [one man for my whole life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRyNzYPASoA&t=29s). Instead, writing about the modern data stack was a way to [get famous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRyNzYPASoA&t=100s), and the way [my manager told me to promote my single](https://youtu.be/rRyNzYPASoA?si=nbQ0lBu4SI67Wud9&t=59). The draw was its popularly, and the audience and attention that came with it.[^3]

Now that audience is largely gone. The [stars of the ](https://deadline.com/2021/06/chris-harrison-leaving-the-bachelor-franchise-controversy-1234771200/)*[Bachelor](https://deadline.com/2021/06/chris-harrison-leaving-the-bachelor-franchise-controversy-1234771200/) *are [off the air](https://www.cascade.io/), [pivoting](https://www.continual.ai/), and [consolidating](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sisu-data_sisu-is-joining-forces-with-snowflake-we-activity-7119690491054485505-7qtI/). And the cool kids are moving on to [dating shows about AI](https://www.netflix.com/title/81610979): The headline on [Snowflake’s website](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) says “​​AI/ML is easier in the data cloud;” on [Databricks’ homepage](https://www.databricks.com/), it says “Your data. Your AI. Your future.”

For thrill seekers and clout chasers, be they bachelors looking for fame, opportunistic founders looking for a quick payday, or yellow journalists looking for clicks, there’s no reason to be here without the audience. The party was the point. 

But for people looking to build durable businesses, the hype has always been a double-edged sword. On one hand, it brought a lot of money and innovative people. Companies were able to raise huge amounts of cash to build a bunch of new stuff, and customers were interested in trying it all out. We built [SQL-powered](https://www.yahoo.com/news/analytics-startup-mode-wants-sql-212815981.html) BI, and [search-powered](https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/19/investors-serve-up-50-million-for-thoughtspots-search-engine-for-enterprise-data/) BI, and [dbt-powered](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/06/lightdash-takes-on-looker-with-an-open-source-bi-platform-built-for-dbt/) BI, and [notebook-powered](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/hex-snags-16m-series-a-to-keep-building-collaborative-data-workspace/) BI. We tested different [flavors](https://www.astronomer.io/) and [frameworks](https://dagster.io/) for orchestration. We tried to replace big OLAP databases with [Spark databases](https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/30/databricks-snags-33m-in-series-b-and-debuts-cloud-platform-for-processing-big-data/), and [streaming databases](https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/materialize-scores-40-million-investment-for-sql-streaming-database/), and [data lake databases](https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/25/dremio-raises-160m-series-e-for-its-data-lake-platform/), and [small databases](https://motherduck.com/blog/big-data-is-dead/). We did ETL in [batch](https://www.fivetran.com/), in [real time](https://www.striim.com/), and in [reverse](https://medium.com/memory-leak/reverse-etl-a-primer-4e6694dcc7fb). More recently, we tried [gluing AI](https://benn.substack.com/p/ai-is-coming-for-your-favorite-products) on to all of it. Just as the bachelorette can speed run through a lot of dates, a hyped industry can speed run through a lot of experimental products and technologies. It’s not the most financially efficient way to figure out who you want to marry or the best architectural framework for orchestrating an operational data pipeline, but it’s the fastest.[^4] 

On the other hand, the frenzy is destabilizing. New ideas and standards are churning in and out of vogue; the buzz creates distractions; customers struggle to distinguish between what is valuable and what is hype. The ground on which companies design and sell their products [shifts under their feet](https://twitter.com/a16z/status/1748038173039722546). Nothing built before 2010 was built for the cloud; nothing built before 2013 was built for cloud data warehouses; nothing built before 2016 was built for dbt; nothing built before 2020 was built for data lakes; nothing built before 2022 was built for AI. Every company and product had to make a bet on which trends will endure—ELT over ETL? Jinja? Open-core products? The popularity of Redshift? Data meshes and contracts?—and hope that they got both their products *and* their market predictions right. Because of that, hype cycles are great for building, but not great for enduring. [Eighty percent of the marriages](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2022/09/19/bachelor-bachelorette-couples-still-together/10381061002/) on the *Bachelor *and *Bachelorette* end in divorce, compared to “only” [fifty percent of everyday mariages](https://www.wf-lawyers.com/divorce-statistics-and-facts/).[^5] 

Though it can be demoralizing for the air to leave the room, there’s a lot of opportunity in the slowdown. Startups just need to change their tactics. Don’t build something new, or go after major incumbents—the wilderness is too hard to tame and the cities are too hard to conquer without a lot of money. The better targets are the helter-skelter frontier towns, built by frenzied founders who wanted to stake their claim on any piece of open ground they could find. Some of these companies—a number of modern data stack startups, basically—uncovered valuable ideas, but built them for a different economic and technical era. They were founded when startups were encouraged to [raise tons of money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZgfTarNxdY) and when the only metric that mattered was growth. They were founded before dbt was popular, or before DuckDB existed, or before companies were especially vigilant about cloud data warehouse costs. But now, because the energy is gone—because a lot of the *Bachelorette* contestants have moved on to the next season—things are more stable. 

In other words, to build a great data business, today’s startups don’t have to come up with particularly novel ideas or get a bunch of bets about the market right. They just have to rebuild what’s already there, but more deliberately and on more certain ground than the original pioneers could.[^6]

[Omni](https://omni.co/) and [SQLMesh](https://sqlmesh.com/) are two companies that seem to be doing exactly that. Omni is, almost literally, a Looker rerun, with [several of the same founders and investors](https://omni.co/about). Though there are minor structural differences between the products, Omni’s primary pitch is about [improved usability](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/16/omni-looks-to-take-on-looker-with-its-cloud-powered-bi-platform/#:~:text=have%20to%20overcome%3A-,poor%20usability,-.%20He%E2%80%99s%20the). It’s mostly the same thing, just polished and built for 2022 instead of 2012. Similarly, SQLMesh [aggressively markets itself](https://tobikodata.com/the-false-promise-of-dbt-contracts.html) as a renovated dbt that’s fundamentally the same product—in-warehouse SQL-based transformations with a web IDE—but built with the advantages of knowing what people liked about dbt, and what they struggled with. 

Of course, there’s no guarantee that these companies will be successful. Looker and dbt are popular, well-resourced, and can do plenty of remodeling themselves. But the strategy—build on a competitor’s land, without the [scars](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1000/1*GnaxpK5-mqlM1mIBFdRFiw.png) that come with settling the territory—seems sound. 

There are a lot of other startups out there that are overburdened and under-built. They’re overfunded and underwater; in business but out of date; in debt but out of energy. There are businesses that were created for the modern data stack’s *party*, and now have to endure the slog of startup life without the excitement of the bright lights that used to come with it. 

So, it’s time to build.[^7] Not me, not on this blog—this is a tabloid for [promoting my mixtape](https://www.etonline.com/bachelorette-frontrunner-jed-wyatt-admits-he-went-on-hannah-browns-season-to-promote-his-music). But for everyone else, this is a real moment of opportunity. In ten years, data teams will have their Notion, their Linear, and their Figma—second and third acts that had the luxury of time and relative tranquility compared to pioneering predecessors. The enduring modern data stack remains to built. It’ll just happen [in the dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsovD9IlT3U).

# Clique

Name this company, from the script of their recent rebrand reveal video:

> Data unlocks possibilities. It drives strategic decisions. It fuels innovation. It's this promise that propels us to solve challenges with data. Data is our rich history. Data is the opportunity. We've reimagined the future. 
> X™
> We are data-obsessed. And listen closely to create impact. We're setting the stage for the AI-powered enterprise. Moving data from any source to any target. Using analytics for rapid insights to drive informed actions. Turning data into outcomes. We're trusted by 40,000 organizations who understand wherever there is data, there is opportunity, possibility, power. 
> Wherever there is data.
> X™

Ok, I don’t know, sure. But I guess it moves product? Because this idea—that “wherever there’s data, there’s power,” which is the headline on the same company’s new website—is the animating sales pitch of this entire industry. Case in ten points: Last fall, I went to a data conference, and, struck by the mimetic marketing glaze that was painted over the whole thing, took pictures of the taglines that companies used to advertise themselves at their booths. Among them:

This sort of message has become so ubiquitous that it’s [become our water](http://bulletin-archive.kenyon.edu/x4280.html). We scarcely even notice it, much less recognize that there’s a fairly radical claim behind it: That data—What data? Doesn’t matter. All data. Customer data. Enterprise data. *Your *data.—is full of potential energy. That data, [as a matter of faith](https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1433636587699539996), is valuable.

But why do we believe that? My point here isn’t to question our religion—it may well be right!—but to question its origins. It can’t be because data is universally useful. Quite famously, a lot of companies struggle to get that much value out of it; much of our industry is also built on selling that challenge. Somehow, though, that gives us *more* conviction in our creed—that the problem is their atheism, and if only they can be taught [our](https://bigdataldn.com/seminar-schedule/practical-steps-for-nurturing-an-analytics-culture/) [cultural](https://bigdataldn.com/seminar-schedule/panel-debate-real-life-lessons-of-navigating-the-journey-to-a-better-data-culture/) [rituals](https://bigdataldn.com/seminar-schedule/data-culture-data-fluency-the-holy-grail/) (and, of course, buy our relics), their data can also be unlocked, maximized, set free, mastered, and brought to life. And ironically, some of the biggest advocates for the power of data are inverted [doubting Thomases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubting_Thomas). Their personal experience—at companies with underfunded data programs, recalcitrant execs, and immature data cultures—should lead them to doubt data’s usefulness. Yet, many are our strongest soldiers, fighting the hardest against the false idols of intuition and experience.

So where does this faith come from? [Nate Silver](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/07/nate-silver-election-forecasts-right)? A few legends from [Facebook](https://andrewchen.com/my-quora-answer-to-how-do-you-find-insights-like-facebooks-7-friends-in-10-days-to-grow-your-product-faster/) and [Target](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html)? *[Moneyball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MjxoaynCmk)*[ and Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MjxoaynCmk)? Because we saw ourselves as [math people](https://benn.substack.com/i/95079164/a-homely-mind)? Or have we just been worn down by the same story about data’s inevitable usefulness for long enough that we now accept it as canon? 

I don’t know. But perhaps that’s the best way to interpret [Qlik’s generic rebrand](https://www.qlik.com/blog/revealing-the-new-qlik-brand) (Qlik is the company; X is Qlik). Churches would never survive if they promised specific miracles. They survive because people believe that miracles are *possible*. And hammering everyone with constant messages of faith that are presented as statements of fact—that Jesus died for our sins; that Muhammad is the messenger of god; that the Torah is a divine covenant; that wherever there’s data, there’s power—is the very thing that makes people believe.

[^1]: Relatively speaking. In no remotely sane sense of the phrase was the modern data stack a “[club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avFq9errZCk)” that was “[popular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbMqWXnpXcA).”

[^2]: [benn.substack](https://benn.substack.com/) is [step one](https://benn.substack.com/i/140621963/carta-again); [benn.buzz](http://benn.buzz/) is [step two](https://benn.substack.com/p/does-venture-capital-ruin-great-products#footnote-2-137729402). So far, it’s all going [according to plan](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7151618974647013376/).

[^3]: I mean, no, this is all kind of a joke. Writing long-form blog posts about databases won’t make you famous; my manager never sent me here to do this, and would probably prefer I just put my head down and did real work. This blog isn’t *that* cynical. But, the parallels between *Bachelorette* contestants and tHoUgHt LeAdErShIp are both funny and broadly true. My eighth-grade self didn’t didn’t dream of being  a “[leader in the dashboarding space](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/leader-in-dashboarding.png);” my interest in writing a blog about data tooling is more general—about economics and finance and social dynamics and gossip—than specific to this market; [attention is an addictive drug](https://benn.substack.com/p/we-all-have-an-audience); and the marriage between me and the modern data stack, though ongoing, is unlikely to be ‘til death does us part.

[^4]: And, for better or for worse, in both cases, some distant third party is paying for most of it anyway.

[^5]: Two points about these numbers. First, about twenty percent of both bachelors and bachelorettes are still married to contestants on their show. But, while all of the bachelorettes are married to the man they chose at the end, four of the five still-married bachelors are married to a *different* contestant. They chose one woman on the show, and, shortly after, changed their mind. I’m sure there’s some statement about the shallowness of man in that. Second, if you google “how many marriages end in divorce,” the top results are all from law firms. So I have no idea if fifty percent is right, or if it’s just Wilkinson & Finkbeiner doing demand gen.

[^6]: This is a pretty [standard development pattern](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-resources/framework-for-innovation/) for products, and it probably works for broader markets too.

[^7]: [Software ate](https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/) [American dynamism](https://a16z.com/american-dynamism/), but now [it’s time to build](https://a16z.com/its-time-to-build/) [techno-optimists](https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/). (Again, this is a joke, but it also kind of works? Software got very popular and lucrative; it contributed to eroding the prestige of manufacturing. Now, the a16z stance is that we should be more optimistic about what technology can do, and build things like airplanes and medical devices instead of SaaS software and iPhone apps.)

*[You’re right. I did that wrong.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_nuZD4Y7IM)*

Most for-profit companies have two sets of values. The first set is universal, often implicit, and kind of unpleasant? It is: Companies value money. At a minimum, they value having enough to survive, but most want more than that. Most companies want to be rich, often as rich as possible, and will make decisions that maximize how rich they can get. 

We know that companies value money because, of course they do, and because companies do a lot of displeasing things to make more of it.[^1] They [fire people](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/11/ceo-posts-crying-selfie-on-linkedin-after-laying-off-employees-and-it-goes-viral-.html). They build factories that pollute the environment. They [tell their employees](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/12/hundreds-covid-cases-reported-tesla-plant-following-musks-defiant-reopening-county-data-shows/) to work in dangerous conditions in those factories. They provide lousy customer service that makes people [mad at them on the internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Breaks_Guitars); they start charging customers [for things that used to be free](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license); they [raise prices](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-much-for-that-dag-in-the-window) when their customers don’t want them to; they sometimes [sue their customers](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/strip-club-sues-oracle-over-employee-s-unpaid-tab-4834821.php) when they are late on their bills. In general, nobody *wants* to do these things,[^2] but people like jobs and money, customers like products, and everyone knows that this is how the whole system works. Deep down, most of us [want capitalism on that wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FnO3igOkOk).

But all of this is somewhat unpleasant to think about, and most people don’t want to lead or work at companies that are singularly motivated to make money as ruthlessly as possible. Most people would prefer some moderation—they would trade some corporate profits for better employee benefits, or cleaner factories, or promises to treat customers respectfully. Most people also care about *how *their employer tries to make money. They want to work at a company that is willing [to move fast and break things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms#History), or [isn’t evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil), or is [radically transparent](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/business/dealbook/bridgewaters-ray-dalio-spreads-his-gospel-of-radical-transparency.html), and they want to work with other people who want similar things. Though these ideas necessarily put constraints on how much money a company can make—a company could always make more money if it had the *option* to be slow, or evil, or deceptive—it’s a deal that most people, including founders, executives and boards, want to make. 

And so, companies will often write a second set of values about how they want to work. Unlike the first set of values, these values are differentiated, prescriptive, and, often, quite appealing. For example, Airbnb values [embracing the adventure](https://careers.airbnb.com/). Atlassian values [playing, as a team](https://www.atlassian.com/company/values). Uber values [building with heart](https://www.uber.com/us/en/careers/values/). Figma values [play](https://www.figma.com/careers/). Pfizer values [joy](https://www.pfizer.com/about/purpose).[^3] Boost Insurance values [always laughing](https://boostinsurance.com/careers/).[^4] Koch Industries values [principled entrepreneurship™](https://www.kochind.com/about/business-philosophy). [I could do this forever.](https://youtu.be/yF1p4qRkTZ8?si=DHa0PtMAx1KcvoH0&t=62) 

It’s not an accident that there are links to nicely designed corporate webpages for this second set of values, and there aren’t any links for the first set. The first set is unpleasant! The second set sounds nice! *Everyone knows *that companies want to make lots of money.[^5] *Everyone knows *that the only true value most companies have is to survive at all legal costs, and maybe some gently illegal ones. *Everyone knows* that if Airbnb, say, isn’t making enough money, it will fire a bunch of people and tell others they need to work more. *Everyone knows* that making money—at least enough to survive—[will always be more important to Airbnb](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/airbnb-coronavirus-layoffs-.html) than *how* it makes that money. That’s how all of this works; there’s no reason for Airbnb to advertise it. It’s much nicer—and much more helpful, when people are trying to decide where they want to work—for Airbnb to say that working at Airbnb is an adventure.

But there are problems with this. First, while everyone knows that companies have to make tradeoffs between making money and anything that isn’t making money, corporate values rarely say where that line is. Is Salesforce committed to [net zero](https://www.salesforce.com/company/our-values/) to the point of shutting itself down? Does Zoom’s dedication to [delivering happiness to its teammates](https://www.zoom.com/en/about/) change when its [income declines](https://investors.zoom.us/static-files/50e0c380-f4bd-4a16-80e3-da56b64017ce) from $1.4 billion in 2021 to $100 million in 2022? How [playful](https://www.lifeatspotify.com/being-here/the-band-manifesto) will Spotify be when it [struggles to turn a profit](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/04/1216950219/spotify-layoffs-17-percent-tech)? There are no easy answers to these questions, but that’s the point—despite values often being framed as constitutional beliefs, they are actually squishy gestures at unknown and unknowable tradeoffs. 

Second, it’s not clear what values are meant to represent. In some cases, they’re presented as personality traits, as a kind of corporate Myers–Briggs. Lego is [imaginative and creative](https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/lego-group/the-lego-brand?locale=en-us); Twilio is [curious](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/company/values); EY values “[teaming](https://www.ey.com/en_us/about-us#:~:text=People%20who%20demonstrate%20integrity%2C%20respect%2C%20teaming%20and%20inclusiveness).”[^6] In other cases, however, values are framed as binding contracts to which both the company and its employees are accountable. Snowflake’s values are [vaguely threatening](https://www.snowflake.com/en/company/overview/about-snowflake/). Coinbase, [famously](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/business/dealbook/coinbase-social-activism.html), makes being [mission first](https://www.coinbase.com/careers/mission-and-culture) a condition of employment. [Lockheed Martin’s core values](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/ethics.html)—printed on an “Ethics Awareness Training” PDF and shared alongside something called the *Code of Ethics and Business Conduct*—are basically a DocuSign from a lawyer. 

This ambiguity creates a quasi-legal apparatus around how both companies and the people who work at them can treat their values. Can you be fired from Stripe for not being “[exothermic](https://stripe.com/jobs/culture)?”[^7] Can an engineer at Meta object to being told to work on something that’s [not awesome](https://www.metacareers.com/culture/)? On one hand, these questions seem ridiculous. On the other hand, are they? They only sound ridiculous because of the *content of the value*. If a Meta engineer objected to working with a manager who was indirect and disrespectful—which would violate another one of Meta’s core values—that would seem very reasonable.

The third problem is that values are often loose and difficult to interpret. The [consulting](https://hbr.org/2012/01/what-wise-leaders-always-follo) [class](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/people%20and%20organizational%20performance/our%20insights/the%20five%20trademarks%20of%20agile%20organizations/the-five-trademarks-of-agile-organizations.pdf) loves to talk about values as a North Star—but a North Star only works if we can figure out where it’s pointing us. If a marketer [at Yeti](https://www.yeti.com/careers.html) asks for help on a project they’re struggling with, are they living the value that “no one succeeds alone”? Or are they failing to “continually strive for improvement”? How do Asana employees judge if they are working with [heartitude](https://asana.com/company)?[^8] Rumble tells itself to “[be fearless in our pursuit](https://corp.rumble.com/careers/#:~:text=Fearless%20in%20our%20pursuit).” That’s it; that’s the end of the sentence. I mean. What?[^9] 

In some ways, though, Rumble’s dangling value is instructive. A lot of values—[make work human](https://jobs.dropbox.com/blogs/dropbox-values); [stay hungry](https://careers.servicenow.com/careers#our-values); generic corporate adjectives like [respect, integrity, and accountability](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/corporate-values); indiscriminate fearless pursuit—don’t *mean* anything. They project a vibe.[^10] Rumble could say their values are Tucker Max, Barstool Sports, crypto, and ivermectin, and it would be very dumb, but everyone would understand exactly what it would be like to work there. 

Or maybe it wouldn’t be dumb? While vague, ambiguous instructions like “We work hard together so we can play hard together” and saying “our values are *Entourage*, the Kelce brothers, and espresso martinis” can describe more or less the same thing, only the former makes an already difficult tradeoff between making money and a company’s softer ambitions—like [inspiring a brighter work day for all](https://www.workday.com/en-us/company/about-workday/core-values.html#:~:text=brighter%20work%20day%20for%20all), which Workday says its wants to do, under a value called profitability?—even more confusing. Only the former can sometimes be used as a unifying mantra in some cases, and a weapon in others. Only the former give both executives and employees the ability to [pick and choose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_hyT7_Bx9o&t=88s) when and how to apply a rule to their liking.

For example, several years ago, Steph Korey, the founder and then-CEO of [Away](https://www.awaytravel.com/), [described the company’s values](https://www.inc.com/steph-korey/away-suitcases-travel-company-culture.html) an evolving, collaborative, aspirational expression of who Away wants to be:

> It's not uncommon for founders to determine what those values are before they even hire their first employee, but it was important for us to involve the team in that process.
> Beyond our earliest employees who developed our values and their definitions, we've continued to revisit them as the team has grown, finding a way to involve and engage our newest employees as the team grows. As the team doubled, and again once it tripled, we came together and asked, "Are these still our core values? How do they come to life?" It's about giving our team the context to understand why they exist, and how they actually guide our work. 
> The result? Our values aren't just words on a wall, but a guiding philosophy that we put into practice every single day. Whether it's being *iterative* to respond to the evolving needs of our business, our team, and our customers, or being *accessible* to encourage transparency and collaboration, or being *in it together*, reminding ourselves to take the work seriously, but never ourselves.

But, infamously, in the midst of a holiday crunch in 2018, the values became a weapon. From [leaked Slack messages](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995453/away-luggage-ceo-steph-korey-toxic-work-environment-travel-inclusion) that she sent to several Away employees:

> I know this group is hungry for career development opportunities, and in an effort to support you in developing your skills, I am going to help you learn the career skill of **accountability**. …To hold you accountable—which is a very important business skill that is translatable to many different work settings—no more pto or wfh requests will be considered from the 6 of you...I hope everyone in this group appreciates the thoughtfulness I’ve put into creating this career development opportunity and that you’re all excited to operate consistently with our core values.

And a few days later, to the same team:

> If you all choose to utilize your **empowerment** to leave our customers hanging so that two of you can take PTO on the same day, you will have convinced me that this group does not embody Away’s core values.

Korey isn’t alone in exploiting the [strategic ambiguity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_of_deliberate_ambiguity) of her company’s values in this way—there are literally guides [for this sort of thing](https://professionalleadershipinstitute.com/resources/firing-over-core-values-violations/): “How do you make the best of a firing, and redeem it so that the entire team (and business) is better for it?  Easy – you fire based on core values violations.”

Even among well-intentioned people, core values can create difficult disagreements. For example, [one of Cloudflare’s values](https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/life-at-cloudflare/) is that they “encourage each other's professional development and growth.” After the [excruciatingly awkward firing of a sales rep](https://www.wsj.com/business/the-tech-employee-who-went-viral-for-filming-her-firing-has-no-regrets-54b61ffe) that [went viral](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1745609324544536778) on TikTok, Cloudflare’s CEO [defended the decision](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1745697840180191501) to fire the rep on the idea in this value: “We think the right thing to do is get people we know are unlikely to succeed off the team as quickly as possible so they can find the right place for them.” But the fired rep—who was let go three months after starting, was barely off her training ramp, and allegedly got little to no negative feedback from her manager—could’ve objected on the same grounds. A company that encourages people’s professional growth, she could’ve reasonably said, would’ve given her more time and more feedback.

These sorts of tension can play out thousands of ways, across thousands of companies. Someone starts a business to solve a problem. A nascent culture starts to develop. The early employees want to protect and codify culture, to retain their character and individuality, and to protect themselves from becoming the same sort of faceless corporate villain that they probably joined the company to get away from. They want to hire new employees who value the same thing. They want to feel like good people, and writing down "we are good people" is an easy way to do that. 

This works for a while. But at some point, the values will get tested. The company won’t be able to both survive and do what it’s historically defined as good. Or the definition of good becomes hard to interpret. Or some decision—like firing a new sales rep who’s fresh off her ramp—will exemplify the value in one way, and violate it in another. And disagreements about business decisions will become moral wars, where both sides believe that they are fighting [with God on their side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0lFNwlLpd4).[^11]

Call me naive, but I don’t think this is anyone’s intent. I don’t think most companies want to deceive or exploit employees, nor do I think most employees want to extort their employers. As funny as it is that Pfizer says one if its values is joy, I think that desire is genuine. What is misleading is how the value is written: It doesn’t say what joy means, when Pfizer will trade joy for profit, and whether or not joy is a goal or a contractual expectation. 

It’s also a missed opportunity to better match employees with employers. Companies *do* have different answers to those questions; everyone just has to make guesses about what they are. [Workday](https://www.workday.com/en-us/company/about-workday/core-values.html), an enterprise human capital management software provider, and [Chubbies](https://www.chubbiesshorts.com/pages/about-us), a lifestyle brand that sells flamboyant short shorts for men, both value “fun.” I’ve never worked at either, but I’m pretty sure they mean it in different ways.

So what if we didn’t have to guess?

Instead of posting and advertising their values, I think we’d all be better served if companies shared *precedents*. “In this situation, in which reasonable people could do lots of different things,” they might say, “here is what we did.” For example:

Rather than making people deduce specific behaviors from a set of generalized values, give them the precedents and let them induce the principles for themselves. The pithy values don’t really matter anyway; what people want to know is what people will do because of them. So just tell them?

Precedents not only clarify where the company draws the line between profit and personality; they also make it plainly clear that there *is* a line. They describe which behaviors a company treats as expectations of employment, and which ones are simply characteristic of how most people currently act. Though they can still be disputed—situations are different; precedents get overturned[^12]—they can’t be twisted to fit the whims of a moment in the same way that values can. And most importantly, precedents are honest. [Deficient precedents will bankrupt even the most magnificent promises.](https://www.npr.org/2010/01/18/122701268/i-have-a-dream-speech-in-its-entirety) People can say they *will* do anything; but nobody can escape what they’ve done. 

To be quite clear, I believe that companies should have values. Mode had them, and I’m proud of both what they stood for and how they were expressed. But if they had a flaw, it was having too much pride in the latter point—I clung to what they said; to how they said it; to the language of them. I was too attached to describing the noble ideal I wanted to chase, and too reluctant to embrace the messy reality in which we had to chase it.

I think every company, Mode included, would be better served by expressing their values directly against that reality. Say what you’ve done in those difficult situations. Give examples of how you balance your moral and cultural aspirations with the inevitable unpleasantries of running a business. Outline your character, not with an unproven and unprovable corporate enneagram, but with your record. [Draw the hypotenuse of compromise.](https://youtu.be/R_nuZD4Y7IM?si=hbPmIzvz7BGSzH3g&t=184)

[^1]: Contrary to popular belief, companies are not* legally obligated* to make as much money as possible. In *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores*, the Supreme Court ruled that, “while it is certainly true that a central objective of for-profit corporations is to make money, modern corporate law does not require for-profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else, and many do not do so.”

[^2]: Ok, some might. [According to their website](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/who-we-are/our-approach/our-guiding-principles), ExxonMobile’s most important guiding principle is “shareholders.”

[^3]: What?

[^4]: What is Boost Insurance, you ask? I have no idea. I work out of coffee shops from time to time (caffeine, I have recently discovered, [is a hell of a drug](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cocaine-is-a-hell-of-a-drug)), and as I was writing this piece, the person next to me was loudly pitching something called Boost. Was it Boost Insurance? Was it [Boost VC](https://www.boost.vc/)? Was it [Boost Coin](https://www.boostco.in/), the [future](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/boost-coin/) of DeFi? Was it [Boost®](https://www.boost.com/), the nutritional drink for adults? Truly, I couldn’t tell. Which, one, it probably says something that I could listen to a conversation for fifteen minutes and not know if it was about an insurance company, venture capital, crypto, or protein shakes, and, two, [don’t talk about your acquisitions at coffee shops](https://benn.substack.com/p/case-for-consolidation#footnote-2-53744915).

[^5]: There are exceptions. OpenAI, for example, almost blew itself up for the opposite reason: The employees wanted to go fast and make lots of money, and the board wanted it to slow down and chill out. But this is pretty weird.

[^6]: What?

[^7]: What?

[^8]: What?

[^9]: I’m being unfair. In Rumble’s case, it’s clear what they’re in pursuit of: [Losing $87 million](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2730/0001213900-23-086112.pdf) every nine months. [Bummer.](https://twitter.com/bennstancil/status/1466238233663225861)

[^10]: For proof that a lot of companies values’ aren’t precisely worded instructions but atmospheric branding, [I don’t think that this is a joke](https://ramp.com/core-values-generator)?

[^11]: This is an overly dramatic, but not entirely. Unlike HR policies and corporate codes of conduct, values are often framed on almost moral terms. And moral disputes have a very different character than policies disputes.

[^12]: It also creates a bias in favor of employees over management. Which is probably a good thing, because the corporate balance of power will always be heavily tilted towards management.The typical company values favor management over employees. When issues arise about what a value means, management can say the employees are simply misinterpreting it. That lets management teams play a bit fast and loose with values; if they ever need to wiggle out of an inconvenient one, it’s not that hard to do. Though sometimes that’s necessary—I am “management,” after all—it shouldn’t be easy. Precedents solve that problem by creating a clear bias towards the status quo—i.e., the promises that were made to employees. Companies can still change them, but it requires a clear explanation about why the change in necessary.

*Not a magic eye. But if you stare at it long enough, maybe you’ll see something.*

Of all the games you can play in a casino, roulette is the least mathematically interesting. In blackjack, there are [strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy) for how to play; because most casinos deal multiple games from a single shuffle, your odds can also vary by hand.[^1] In craps, each roll is independent, the [odds are at least somewhat complicated to calculate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps). 

Roulette is one giant dice roll. Every bet is mathematically identical—you bet on some number of pockets on the wheel; your odds of winning are the number of pockets you bet on divided by the total number of pockets. That’s it; that’s the whole game. Wikipedia [explains it all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette#Simplified_mathematical_model) with [fourth grade](https://www.schools.nyc.gov/learning/student-journey/grade-by-grade/elementary-school-learning) math.

A former analytics [coworker of mine](https://twitter.com/joelcarron)[^2] was recently in Las Vegas, and noticed that the roulette tables are now equipped with dashboards that show historical results from previous spins. There were tables, distribution charts, and callouts for which numbers were hot and cold. People were studying them, he said, like day traders who look at the random twitches on a stock chart and see alpha. “On this table,” they must’ve been saying to each other, “there’s a [congestion area](https://www.forbes.com/2000/06/03/feat.html?sh=391e53b03508) from numbers 10 through 14, and the 6’s [double top](https://www.forbes.com/2000/06/03/feat.html?sh=391e53b03508) is establishing a clear [resistance band](https://www.forbes.com/2000/06/03/feat.html?sh=391e53b03508), so I think everything below 18 is a [bull trap](https://www.forbes.com/2000/06/03/feat.html?sh=391e53b03508). The [measured moves](https://www.forbes.com/2000/06/03/feat.html?sh=391e53b03508) of numbers 30 to 36 are already near the [support level](https://www.forbes.com/2000/06/03/feat.html?sh=391e53b03508) and starting to [test](https://www.forbes.com/2000/06/03/feat.html?sh=391e53b03508) the [top](https://www.forbes.com/2000/06/03/feat.html?sh=391e53b03508), so I’m betting hard there.”

Hahaha. Fools. How ridiculous of them, these ignorant wretches, intoxicated by a few charts and blinking lights, drunk and dizzy from staring into an endless abyss of meaningless numbers. 

...I say, as I return to my day job of churning out glittery dashboards, of squinting at oscillating trend lines, and of ad-libbing my own methods of technical analysis—“we’re below our goal but if draw a regression line through a few arbitrary points, and adjust for the holidays, by ignoring them, and extrapolate that trend forward by three months, then we can see…well, we’re still behind, but we think [it will turn around](https://images.app.goo.gl/8JBaRLC1AkYsi6s47), because that [which is measured, improves](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/14952/that-which-is-measured-improves), right?” 

Cedric Chin has [seen enough](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1751582951748628764) of this sort of astrology: 

> There are a gajillion articles about 'the modern data stack' and 'data warehouse good' and 'how to do data modeling', and not a single one about what to do when you look at a chart.

[He writes](https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-first-principles/):

> When you open a business dashboard in your company, do you feel a little confused? Like you don’t know what to do? I mean, look at this chart [he shows a wiggly line, with no clear pattern]. What can you conclude from it? Is the metric doing well? Is it going up overall? Is it business as usual? Or are things getting worse? Should you be worried?
> If you’re like most people — myself included — you would not know how to read actual charts of real world operational data. You would open up Google Analytics and think … “so what?”. 

Chin has been thinking and [writing](https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-in-business/) about this problem for a while. His solution to our confusion, forged in the operational trenches of companies like Amazon and Toyota, is a six-step process:

On one hand, yes, obviously? Of course this is what we should do. We do this all the time. We listen to a song by a new band;[^3] we like it more than the average band; we listen to another song; we learn that we like that band. We day trade crypto; we lose money; we try it again; we learn that day trading crypto is a control factor that influences the balance of our bank account. We email a bunch of sales prospects about our product; we get more positive responses than usual; we try that same email again and *don’t* get more positive responses; we learn that we probably just got lucky the first time.[^4] None of this is rocket science. It’s barely even *science*.

On the other hand, there’s something profound about Chin’s post. Despite having read hundreds of Medium articles and VC blogs about how about which [product adoption metrics](https://amplitude.com/blog/top-digital-product-adoption-metrics) are best, or how to understand [user cohorts](https://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2012/05/know-your-user-cohorts.html), or how to [benchmark your company’s KPIs](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/t/benchmarks), it was Chin’s post, and only Chin’s post, that inspired me to immediately dump a bunch of Substack metrics into a spreadsheet and see they taught me.[^5] Why, despite the underlying theory being simple, obvious, and something I already do informally every day, did Chin’s articulation of it land so differently?

One answer is packaging—it’s an engaging read; he prescribes a way to find anomalies, called XmR charts, that have a [satisfying visual aesthetic](https://two-wrongs.com/statistical-process-control-a-practitioners-guide.html); the social proof from Amazon, and from the depth of Chin’s own research, is hard to ignore. But none of those things are that unique. Every data conference is full of glossy presentations about how some amazing company built itself, and we often start forgetting those talks before they’re even over.

The better answer, I think, is that Chin’s post *gives us permission to make this simple*. When we look across a sea of data, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the difficulty and depth of it all. It's easy to assume that there are so many complications; so much confounding; so many numbers; so little time. When working in this sort of environment, we often [play up to the complexity of our competition](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/playing-up-or-down-to-the-competition/)—by using [candlestick charts](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/candlestick-charting-what-is-it/), or fancy math, or formal theories of causal inference, or our time-honored tradition of smugly saying, “well, you see, *it depends*.” 

Chin tells us to throw all of that out. He’s studied this more than we have, and has talked to people who made this work better than we did. And he says it’s okay to draw some trend lines, to kinda eyeball some error bars, and to not fret too much about the details. The power of this instruction isn’t in what it tells us to do—most of us are already pretty accustomed to looking at dashboards and trying to figure out why it went up and down—but in what it tells us *not to do*. Don’t try to solve your problems in a novel way, he says; try just drawing these charts first. Don’t worry about those wiggles, unless they persist for too long or get too severe. Don’t worry about the precise methods for detecting anomalies; use this simple formula.[^6]

As an analyst, an executive, a day trader, or even a blogger starting at a few Substack dashboards, every chart is a temptation—surely, you think, if you look at it at just the right angle, [it will reveal its secrets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Eye). *This* is why casinos, which [control every input on their gambling floors](https://gizmodo.com/how-casinos-use-design-psychology-to-get-you-to-gamble-1667182023), put dashboards on roulette wheels—not to inform us, but to bait our natural inclinations to see patterns in every chart.   

Chin reminds us of the danger of this approach. When you investigate everything, you find nothing; when you find nothing, you doubt your methods; and when you doubt your methods, [you flail](https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-first-principles/#why-become-data-driven:~:text=You%20discern%20no%20clear%20pattern%3B%20you%20chalk%20it%20up%20to%20a%20%E2%80%9Cmaaaybe%3F%E2%80%9D%20and%20move%20on%20to%20the%20next%20idea.%20You%20don%E2%80%99t%20get%20any%20feedback%20on%20your%20moves.%20You%E2%80%99re%20like%20a%20blind%20archer%2C%20shooting%20arrows%20into%20the%20dark.):

> You discern no clear pattern; you chalk it up to a “maaaybe?” and move on to the next idea. You don’t get any feedback on your moves. You’re like a blind archer, shooting arrows into the dark.

But we already know how to aim: Look for variation, ask what caused it, repeat. We don’t need to teach ourselves how to do this; we just need to be reminded—as Chin is reminding us, now—that those simple steps are enough.

[Aimé Leon Dore](https://www.aimeleondore.com/), commonly known as ALD, is a popular men’s fashion brand based in New York City. Like most lifestyle boutiques, it’s popular for two reasons: Because people like its aesthetic, and because people *like the people who like its aesthetic*. From [a profile of the brand in the ](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/style/aime-leon-dore-nyc.html)*[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/style/aime-leon-dore-nyc.html)*, “the ALD experience extends beyond clothes into…what worlds wearing those clothes will associate you with.” 

Today, that world is [Queens](https://www.aimeleondore.com/pages/about-us); that aesthetic is [vintage Ralph Lauren](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=601107417&q=vintage+ralph+lauren&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiNsd7Xu_aDAxUUrpUCHWlUDz4Q0pQJegQICxAB&biw=1512&bih=857&dpr=2) and [classic hip-hop and basketball](https://www.purveyour.com/spotlights/aime-leon-dore); those people are [George Costanza](https://putthison.com/is-george-costanza-aime-leon-dores-muse/) and [Nas](https://www.aimeleondore.com/blogs/news/nasir-jones-for-aime-leon-dore-clarks-originals). According to ALD’s *About Us* [page](https://www.aimeleondore.com/pages/about-us), you can learn more about ALD by listening to Nas’ *[Illmatic](https://music.apple.com/us/album/illmatic/662324135)*; according to Nas, he wears [Aime Leon Dior New Balance when he’s steppin’](https://genius.com/27108269).

[Greg Gutfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Gutfeld) is a 59-year old white Fox News host. He is, in his own words, [relentlessly pro-business](https://reason.com/2009/09/18/what-youre-left-with-is-libert/). On his Fox show, he’s interviewed [Vivek Ramaswamy](https://twitter.com/Gutfeldfox/status/1749589360532398170), [Piers Morgan](https://twitter.com/Gutfeldfox/status/1748144025389965689), and [Dennis Miller](https://twitter.com/Gutfeldfox/status/1747414032737345924). He [wrote a book](https://ggutfeld.com/books/not-cool-the-hipster-elite-and-their-war-on-you/#.Uw7iYVeZh3U) declaring that the “hipster elite” aren’t cool, arguing that “the real American ideal of cool” is “building businesses, protecting freedom at home and abroad, taking responsibility for your actions, and leaving other people alone.” He’s navigating a midlife crisis by [wearing](https://www.facebook.com/GutfeldFox/photos/a.1874071169528625/1874071176195291/?type=3) [colorful](https://twitter.com/JesseBWatters/status/1129489226154881024) [sneakers](https://images.app.goo.gl/YAnpNadswSVUmo5m9). 

This month, he also [started wearing ALD](https://twitter.com/dieworkwear/status/1749654874864902560). 

So that’s awkward. ALD, and to some degree every lifestyle brand, is valuable by association. It’s cool because its customers are cool. What do you do, when you spend years building a brand out of the multicultural and colorful flair of the “[world’s borough](https://www.collater.al/en/aime-leon-dore-ss22-editorial-style/),” and suddenly every [Republican dad’s](https://www.tiktok.com/@comedychronicle/video/7290260219874037035) favorite variety show host starts wearing your sweaters on national television? What do you do if his fans—fans like [Thaddeus](https://ricochet.com/podcast/king-of-stuff/greg-gutfeld-best-albums-2017/), who “will never like hip hop”—start buying your polos? 

Can ALD pay Gutfeld *not* to wear their clothes? If they did, could other Fox News hosts extort their own anti-sponsorships? Imagine—Brian Kilmeade in [Kith](https://www.instagram.com/kith/?hl=en); Neil Cavuto in [WTAPS](https://www.instagram.com/wtaps_tokyo/?hl=en); Newt Gingrich in [BAPE](https://www.instagram.com/bape_us/?hl=en). If oil companies can get carbon credits for [not drilling oil wells](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-07-12/it-s-easy-to-make-oil-companies-esg), can society’s undesirables—[white nationalists with eleven million Twitter followers](https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson), [hated musicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Stapp),[^7] [the Sackler family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sackler_family), [millennials](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-versus-gen-z-it-generation-cool-fashion-trends-pandemic-2021-9)—get paid to not stain cool things with their poisonous endorsements? Is this how we finally break the Gen Z obsession with [Stanley](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/how-the-stanley-cup-went-viral), not by talking about how [dangerous they are](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/01/31/stanley-cup-lead-claims/), but by talking about how much we love them too?[^8] *[The Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_(talk_show))* loves to complain about the creative power of [Taylor Swift’s endorsements](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/business/media/taylor-swift-fox-trump.html), but has the *The Five* thought about the destructive power of theirs?

Or would that only make these brands stronger? Could ALD embrace Gutfeld, not as a sponsor, or an anti-sponsor, but as a kind of double-agent sponsor? They made something so cool he couldn’t resist it, and their commitment to that coolness—proven by their willingness to sacrifice the brand rather than pay Gutfeld a dime—only makes them cooler. By attempting to ransom money out of ALD, Gutfeld would only make them more of a hero. By trying to strike them down, Gutfeld would only [make them more powerful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVBX7l2zgRw).

I mean, on one hand, who knows, who cares, how did we even get here. On the other hand, the world *does* kind of work like this now? We buy tons of stuff because influencers tell us to. People have careening opinions about the NFL, vaccines, Tesla, and Bud Light because of who’s in their ads and who promotes them. I don’t want to buy a business class seat on Twitter, not because of what it costs, but because who’s charging me for it. If you’re an influencer—or whatever Greg Gutfeld is—it seems short-sighted to only ask to be paid for the things you do. You can only do so many things! Much better to get paid for the things you don’t do.

[^5]: I made a [chart](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/xmr.png)! Of new blog subscribers! Which, two thoughts:Even for very prescriptive methods like this, there’s still an [entire garden of forking analytical paths](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf). Over what window do you create your average and moving ranges? And should it be rolling, or, something like a quarterly or annual step function? Or constant for the entire time period? I’m sure there are some recommendations here, though I couldn’t find any. In any case, it didn’t really matter here, and the conclusions were basically the same: Something changed, and for the worse, in the fall of 2022. What was that thing? Did the articles get bad? I mean, probably. Did I hit a niche data blog’s [invisible asymptote](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/5/21/invisible-asymptotes)? Also very possible.

Over time, other methods may make sense. But XmR charts are good starting points, because they generally work, because they’re easy to build and understand, and because they’re a good way to break people’s habits of looking at metrics as something to optimize, and instead think of them as a way to figure out how controllable inputs affect desired outputs.

> *The moment, you own it, you better never let it goYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blowThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime*
> Lose Yourself*, Eminem*

One way to think about Dan Campbell and the Detroit Lions is that they found a strategy that worked for a season, but didn’t work for a game. 

For years, quants have been begging NFL coaches to go for it on fourth down more often. In 2006, David Romer, a prominent academic economist, [published a formal mathematical model](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~dromer/papers/JPE_April06.pdf) that found that coaches punt way more than they should, and frequently made “systematic, clear-cut, and overwhelmingly statistically significant departures from the decisions that would maximize teams’ chances of winning.” In 2009, Romer’s arguments—sparked by an [unconventional fourth-down call](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/11/13/20962514/nfl-fourth-down-conversion-patriots-lamar-jackson) by (now unemployed) Patriots’ coach Bill Belichick—started [getting more attention](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704431804574540100532247022). In 2014, the *New York Times *created a (now defunct) [Twitter bot](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/upshot/greetings-from-the-nyt-4th-down-bot.html) that analyzed fourth down decisions in real time, and harassed coaches when they ignored the numbers and punted. 

At first, coaches stuck to their conservative guns. From 2006 through 2017, NFL teams consistently went for it on fourth down [about ten percent of the time](https://medium.com/@dacr444/analyzing-4th-down-attempts-over-the-last-24-seasons-8c0f99c538cb). But in 2018, things changed: Teams steadily started going for it more often. Today, the league-wide “go for it” rate is [just under twenty percent](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/#all_team_conversions).

No coach has been more aggressive than Dan Campbell. In 2021, Campbell was hired as the Detroit Lions’ head coach. At that time, the highest single-season “go for it” rate was 25.4 percent, by the 2020 Philadelphia Eagles. Today, the three highest rates are the [2021 Detroit Lions](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/#all_team_conversions), at 29.5 percent; the [2022 Detroit Lions](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2022/#all_team_conversions), at 29.6 percent; and the [2023 Detroit Lions](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/#all_team_conversions), at 30.5 percent. 

By at least one very crude measure, Campbell’s strategy has worked. After finishing [dead last](https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings/_/season/2021/group/conference) in their conference in 2021, the Lions finished [third](https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings/_/group/conference) this year—and, two weeks ago, were playing in the NFC championship game, one win away from making their first Super Bowl in franchise history.

With [Eminem in the audience](https://twitter.com/KennyKing_Jr/status/1751761887438708922), the Lions took a big early lead against the San Francisco 49ers. The lead slipped, the game tightened, and twice in the second half, the Lions’ found themselves facing a fourth and short, inside the San Francisco thirty yard line. Twice, they had a choice: Kick a field goal, or play the way they have for the last three years, and go for it. Twice, they went for it. [And twice](https://youtu.be/hFQy0I3g8co?si=YlE-_LreL8aob_-U&t=546), they [got stopped](https://youtu.be/hFQy0I3g8co?si=OtXOCeUPvPVjKm_j&t=781). 

In at least a superficial sense, the two decisions cost the Lions the game. Their gambles took six potential points off the board; [they lost by three](https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547380/lions-49ers).[^1]

After the game, the media [pressed Campbell](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39414214/lions-coach-dan-campbell-regret-costly-4th-calls) about the two calls. Other NFL coaches [blamed the nerds](https://twitter.com/ProFootballTalk/status/1752040878728716333) and their dweeby models. The nerds [fired back](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1752196364941803701). Armchair analysts—i.e., [random](https://twitter.com/kct2020/status/1751970232392880429) [tweets](https://twitter.com/Amazianx/status/1751849897442099206) [I](https://twitter.com/GhettoBird_Cube/status/1751794423640305779) [saw](https://twitter.com/Christo_MoNa/status/1751967739374166110)—wondered what went wrong. Did the models not account for how good the Lions’ kicker was? Did they adjust for the pressure of the playoffs? For the game being in San Francisco? For the Detroit Lions [being the Detroit Lions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Detroit_Lions_season)? For the [great disturbance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKu7TYWNxqA) in [cosmic gravity of the NFL](https://www.tiktok.com/@nflonfox/video/7323801950854663467) that could render our entire understanding of the game, of its mathematical properties, and of the very physics of our universe, null and void?[^2] 

The unsatisfying truth is probably simpler than that: Neither fourth down decision mattered all that much. According to [ESPN’s models](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lions.png), on each fourth down attempt, the Lions increased their chances of winning by about 0.3 percent by going for it instead of kicking a field goal. Even if the models underestimate the importance of the choice by an order of magnitude—if the swing was three percentage points—the *decision *to go for it wasn’t all that consequential. 

Put differently, in both cases, the Lions were given two coins, and had to choose which one to flip. One coin landed on heads fifty percent of the time, and the other landed on heads, at most, 53 percent of the time. If the Lions flipped heads, they’d take a huge advantage in the game; if they flipped tails, they’d be put at a huge disadvantage. Though the *result* of the coin toss would clearly affect the outcome of the game, there isn’t much practical difference between which coin they choose to flip.

Flipping the favored coin *over the course of the entire season, *however, can make a big difference. Teams average about eight fourth downs a game. If, on one of those eight attempts—which is exactly how much more the Lions went for it this year compared to the NFL average—a team flipped the coin that landed on heads 53 percent of time instead of fifty, they’d win half a game more per season.[^3] In a league in which a third of the teams were one win away [from either making the playoffs or missing them](https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings/_/group/conference), that’s a significant swing, even if no individual choice is all that consequential.[^4]  

To overstylize the point, the Lions won in the regular season not just because they found an edge, but because they found an edge that they *could exploit a lot*. In the playoffs, when they had two plays—[two shots, two opportunities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Yhyp-_hX2s), to seize everything they ever wanted—that advantage was too small to matter. If you only get a couple rolls, playing the odds is still a crapshoot. 

At a glance, all of this is sort of boring and obvious. The decision to go for it is a probabilistic gamble, and sometimes, the mathematically correct bet still loses. You can [hit on twelve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy) and bust; you can stand on nineteen and lose if the dealer draws twenty. That’s how probabilities work; we all know this. Still, I think it’s a useful analogy for a bad way to use data, for a good way to try to use data, and for a way to make data actually useful.

# Not data or intuition, but secret third thing

Most of the time, we don’t need data to make a decision. NFL coaches don’t need analysts to tell them to punt on fourth and twelve on their own 22-yard line. Blockbuster clerks didn’t need a neural net to tell them that people who liked *Happy Gilmore* will probably like *The Waterboy*. None of us need to carefully study months of New York traffic data to figure out that we shouldn’t try to [drive across Manhattan](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Brooklyn,+NY/MetLife+Stadium,+MetLife+Stadium+Drive,+East+Rutherford,+NJ/@40.748052,-74.1065543,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m18!4m17!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c24416947c2109:0x82765c7404007886!2m2!1d-73.9441579!2d40.6781784!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2f861ad5902bf:0x8184280d31051734!2m2!1d-74.074457!2d40.8135064!2m3!6e0!7e2!8j1707490800!3e0?entry=ttu) at 3 p.m. on a Friday afternoon. Venture capitalists don’t need a meticulous data room from every startup to pass on most investment pitches; product managers often don’t need to run detailed A/B tests to know if their customers like a new releases; bloggers don’t need to study their Substack dashboards to know when a post is a hit or a flop. As Amazon distinguished scientist Garrett van Ryzin [put it](https://notes.causal.engineering/archive/locally-optimal/), “when a project we work on succeeds, we don't need statistics to know it.”

Data [helps on the edges](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-data-driven-companies-win#%C2%A7place-your-bets:~:text=Data%20offers%20the%20same%20promise.%20Its%20constant%20presence%20in%20an%20organization%20is%20like%20knowing%20the%20count%20of%20the%20deck.%20Though%20it%20makes%20us%20a%20bit%20more%20informed%20in%20each%20decision%2C%20the%20effect%20is%20only%20felt%20in%20the%20aggregate%2C%20as%20the%20small%20edge%20compounds%20over%20time.). It give us a slightly more promising coin when it’s fourth and three on your opponent’s 35-yard line; when you have to choose between recommending *The Waterboy* or *Billy Madison*; when you’re deciding between taking the Lincoln Tunnel or the Holland Tunnel; and when you’re excited about an investment but have a couple lingering concerns. That’s the entire point, in most cases—for data to make visible the small differences we can’t see on our own.[^5]  

In this light—that data won’t make any one decision that much better, but only bias it a bit more in our favor—it’s tempting to look for leverage by applying it to the most important decisions. In corporate contexts, there’s also a lot of prestige in these decisions. And so we say, [put us in the boardroom](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-missing-analytics-executive), where our powers will be amplified by the importance of the issues that we apply them to.

We’re probably better off going in the exact opposite direction. Instead of analyzing how we can improve infrequent, high-leverage decisions, we should try to figure out how we can make the *frequent, *low-leverage ones* *better.* *Be like a high-frequency trader, chasing small bits of mechanical alpha in every trade. Be like Google, and find ways to improve ad conversion rates by some tiny percentage. Don’t be intuition-driven or data-driven; be quantity-driven, and look exclusively for places where you can create a durable advantage through frequent, small—and in the aggregate, predictable—bets that you’ve tilted in your favor. 

# Ok, a secret fourth thing

But actually? I think that’s mostly terrible advice. It’s more folklore and fairy tales about the predictive power of big data. Though it sounds easy enough—in reams of data about ad clicks, or user behaviors patterns, or NFL play-by-play logs, how hard can it be to find a few optimizations?—it’s actually very difficult to pull off. It took several years, millions of dollars, and a [globally famous competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) for Netflix to improve their recommendations by ten percent. Even small improvements are hard to find. 

It’s possible, though, to invert the problem. Rather than trying to make frequent decisions better, we probably should try to make good decisions more frequent. Don’t use data to get good at something we do a lot; use data to figure out what we’re good at, and then do it more often. Make data a [StrengthsFinder©](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/254033/strengthsfinder.aspx).

Was Mr. Beast that much better at hacking YouTube than other creators? Was Y Combinator that much better at selecting startups than other incubators? Was Taylor Swift that much better at making music than every other pop star? I’d argue no. They just found a small edge that they naturally had—Mr. Beast stumbled into a teen shock jock genre that people liked; YC had a popular brand and marketable founder; Taylor Swift made catchy and relatable songs—and they hammered it. Mr. Beast had made a video [every five days for a decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MrBeast_videography); YC went from accepting [ten companies per cohort to 400](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies); Taylor Swift can’t stand in front of a microphone [without announcing a new album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI1l2_zss3k).

It’s easy, I think, to get caught up in the allure of the big moment. We all want our fifteen minutes. If you’re a marketer, the glory is in the [viral moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX9qSaGXFyg). If you’re a great writer, your legacy seemingly depends on [your magnum opus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter). And if you’re an NFL coach, your career depends on what happens in the playoffs. But no matter how good you are—at the thing, or at studying the data around the thing—you’ll never create a durable advantage by constantly betting the house. Those advantages come from the [boring compounding of small biases](https://commoncog.com/capital-allocation-antidote-to-business-luck/#:~:text=Good%20capital%20allocation%20can%20only%20be%20celebrated%20after%20a%20period%20of%20decades%20%E2%80%94%20it%20is%20never%20amazing%20in%20the%20moment.).

In sports, however, you sometimes have to bet the house. In almost everything else we do, the results of our decisions are more fungible; we rarely *have *to go risk everything in a winner-take-all championship game. We can find the things we’re a little bit better at than most, figure out how to run that play over and over and over, and let them multiply in an eternal regular season.

[^1]: Here’s a question about this that bothers me: How do you judge if Campbell’s analysis here was right? On one hand, it definitely wasn’t; they lost. On the other hand, he probably played the odds correctly? It seems crazy to define decisions only by their outcomes (very dumb things that shouldn’t work out sometimes do), but it also seems crazy to ignore the outcome? I think I’m still in the [same place I was on this years ago](https://twitter.com/bennstancil/status/1446598343245774850)—“right” is basically a social definition, and a decision’s correctness depends on how much other people agree that it was correct.

[^2]: Millions of voices suddenly [cried out in terror](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/rob-gronkowski-too-much-taylor-swift-nfl-broadcasts-1235454513/), and were [they’re being too loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkk9gvTmCXY).

[^3]: This is pretty similar to the Romer’s original estimates. In his 2006 paper, he found that being appropriately aggressive on fourth down would result in “an increase of about 2.1 percentage points in the probability of winning” any given game, and improve a team’s record by a little more than a third of a win per season.

[^4]: That said, one boneheaded play call may have cost the Lions; it just wasn’t either fourth down attempt. With 1:03 left in the fourth quarter, the Lions were down by ten, had the ball on 49ers three yard line, and, critically, still had all three timeouts left. If they were able to score without using a timeout, they could potentially get the ball back without needing to recover an onside kick. If they *didn’t* have all of their timeouts, however, they needed to recover the kick—and because of a series of recent rule changes, the onside kick recovery rate in the NFL has collapsed [from 15 percent to 5 percent](https://operations.nfl.com/gameday/analytics/stats-articles/where-have-all-the-points-gone/#:~:text=Onside%20kick%20recovery%20rate%20remains,%25%20recovery%20rate%20before%202018).).*Inexplicably, on third down, the Lions ran the ball. They got stopped and* then called a timeout*. Why?!! It makes no sense. Hustle to the line, and run a fourth down play. Kick a quick field goal and save yourself a chance to throw a Hail Mary when you’re down by seven. Anything. But how can you not save that timeout, when calling it all but guarantees you’ll lose?* I’m all for the [Greg Schiano and Jon Bois proposal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_SsIKgwvz4&t=838s) to get rid of both kickoffs and onside kicks entirely. Under their proposal, when a team scores, they would be given the ball back on their own thirty. Rather than it being first and ten, however, it would automatically be fourth and fifteen. In most cases, the team would probably choose to punt, so the result would be more or less the same as a kickoff—the receiving team getting the ball around their own 25. But they could also just try to convert the fourth and fifteen, which would be risky, but, one, actually achievable, two, a normal football play unlike whatever nonsense an onside kick is, and three, very exciting. Plus, it would be easy to adjust the competitive balance of the rule. Want more recoveries? Make it fourth and ten. Want fewer? Make it fourth and 25 (but just not [fourth and 26). ](https://twitter.com/PatrickMurphyPA/status/1481432196741275651)

[^5]: We data folk sometimes sell a more dramatic narrative about data leading to some eureka moment—[Burbn](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/instagram-used-to-be-called-brbn/373815/) should pivot to a photo-sharing app!

There is, it seems, a [rough](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/vision-pro-review-24-hours-in-apples-mixed-reality-headset/05CD2E77-897D-49A9-A87E-9B8A93E3E45F) [consensus](https://stratechery.com/2024/the-apple-vision-pro/) [forming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvkgmyfMPks) about the Apple Vision Pro: The first version won’t change your life, but future models might. Nearly every reviewer says that the headset that Apple launched a few weeks ago has too many rough edges and technical inconveniences to revolutionize everyday living—the field of view is too narrow; small text is hard to read; typing is frustrating; it’s an intensely solitary experience. However, despite its current limitations, the device [teases the much bolder thing that Apple really wants to build](https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price#:~:text=optical%20AR%2C%20where%20light%20passes%20directly%20through%20unobtrusive%20glasses%20to%20your%20eyes%2C%20with%20digital%20information%20layered%20over%20the%20top%20of%20what%20you%E2%80%99re%20seeing.): True augmented reality, “where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing.” They aren’t trying to build an [entertainment console](https://www.meta.com/quest/); they’re building the next “[accompaniment device](https://stratechery.com/2024/the-apple-vision-pro/#:~:text=accompaniment%20device),” meant to be as ubiquitous and as revolutionary as the iPhone.[^1] 

Notably, Apple hasn’t really said any of this. Tim Cook hasn’t trotted out a quarterly release schedule; there is no corporate blog post talking about some [master plan](https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me) of putting [a computer on every face in every home](https://money.cnn.com/2015/04/05/technology/bill-gates-email-microsoft-40-anniversary/). Outside of a [couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX9qSaGXFyg) sizzle [reels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY4x85zqoJM), we’ve all been left to imagine what Vision Pro might become on our own. If the similarity of the reviews are any indication, we’re all now anticipating the same future—not by being told what it will be, but by seeing it, on two 4K TVs an inch from our eyes.[^2] 

This, I think, is what makes a truly visionary product. Visionary products aren’t just things that seem to reach ahead in time and pull something from the future into the present; they’re products that make that future obvious and inevitable to people who couldn’t see it before. Visionary products aren’t the manifestation of someone’s dream; they’re products that manifest the same dream in others. They don’t just teleport us to a new destination; they hang new stars in the sky, navigating all of us, en masse and in sync, in the same direction.

Put differently, visionary products are [Schelling points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)).[^3] Schelling points are meeting points that people congregate towards without any explicit instruction to do so. If you had to meet someone in Paris on Sunday and couldn’t make a plan about when and where to do it, the Eiffel Tower at noon is a Schelling point. If two people had to say the same word at the same time, and the only clue was “pepperoni,” “pizza” would be a Schelling point. And if you want to create a revolutionary new way to embed technology into people's daily lives, the experiential potential of a product like the Vision Pro is a Schelling point for an ecosystem of technologists trying to imagine what sort of computing paradigm might be next, and how we might interact with it. 

Apple imagined a future; they showed us that future through an incomplete but revelatory product experience; we now understand that future, turning what was a vague and fuzzy and scattered vision of augmented reality into a singular destination. And now, I suspect, thousands of developers are marching us towards that beacon.

Of course, the Vision Pro could still be a flop. That destination could be too ambitious, or not as compelling as people think it might be. And Schelling points don't always work—some people could end up at the top of the Eiffel Tower, some at the base, and some at Notre-Dame.[^4]

But it's hard to imagine the Vision Pro being revolutionary *without* a Schelling point. With no shared destination, engineers and partners and app builders will all chase different ideas. [There won’t be an ecosystem](https://stratechery.com/2024/the-apple-vision-pros-missing-apps/) of people standing on each other’s shoulders, [working in rough harmony towards a common goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwUkb7PoKYE). There will instead be a community of scattershot hobbyists and opportunistic founders, building in no particular direction at all. 

This is one way to think about the convulsive collapse of the crypto market. Even after a decade of technological bluster, the crypto community never produced a coherent vision of what living in a blockchain-enabled future would actually *look* like. There were a lot of vague promises about borderless financial markets, and smart contracts, and [a decentralized internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpwj-Um1nbI). But none of this felt tangible. The problems that the blockchain was supposed to solve were often abstract, theoretical, and hard to locate in our daily lives. And so, no experiential Schelling points ever emerged. Instead, most companies worked for themselves, building *their *experience rather than *the* experience. Without a shared sense of direction, the ecosystem began to work against itself, fought itself, and pulled itself apart, until it splintered and shattered and became a dying echo of what we were all promised it would be.

Anyway, speaking of—the modern data stack. 

Last week, Tristan Handy [wrote an obituary for the term](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/is-the-modern-data-stack-still-a), saying that it’s outlived its usefulness: His argument, roughly paraphrased, is this:

Tristan is [a more careful historian](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/future-of-the-modern-data-stack) and [more central character](https://www.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/about-us) in the modern data stack’s story than I am, so I can’t disagree with his narrative too much. But as a [bigger cynic](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-internet-2022) than him, I think he omits one very key element of this story: The problem wasn’t the market around* *the products we were building; *the problem was the product itself*.

—

In the modern data stack’s early days, most vendors were trying to replicate what already existed, but in ways that were bigger, faster, and cheaper. There was a fairly clear experiential Schelling point then—make data practitioners lives better by recreating Oracle, MicroStrategy, Informatica, SAS, and a handful of other geriatric, proprietary, and expensive data tools using the cloud, open-source languages, and consumer-grade user interfaces. Fivetran was Informatica and SnapLogic, but [automated and simple](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/fivetran-announces-15m-series-a-to-build-automated-data-pipelines/). “Snowflake [saw an opportunity](https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/21/snowflake-computing-gets-26m-to-modernize-the-data-warehouse/#:~:text=Snowflake%20saw%20an%20opportunity%20to%20modernize%20this%20concept%20by%C2%A0reducing%C2%A0the%20complexity%20and%C2%A0putting%20the%20whole%20thing%20in%20the%20cloud.) to modernize [the data warehouse] by reducing the complexity and putting the whole thing in the cloud.” Mode’s early fundraising decks [compared it to SAS](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mode-sas.png), but powered by SQL and Python. 

It’s what happened next when things went wrong. Tristan describes the explosive phase that followed—the blow out, in the narrative above—as a largely positive period of [dynamic innovation and fruitful coordination](https://roundup.getdbt.com/i/141505348/eventually-an-ecosystem):

> The end-to-end problem was far too big for any one startup to solve, and so swim lanes were established and partnership ruled the day.
> There was a lot of valuable co-marketing, partnership deals, co-sponsored events, and co-selling. This had real value for everyone involved—customers and vendors alike. Companies voluntarily integrated their products together, cross-promoted each other publicly, and built partnerships that made owning and operating these technologies far easier for customers. …
> This was a beautiful thing. Private capital fueling founders, who not only built their own products but were consciously coming together to build an ecosystem, leading to the rapid buildout of interoperable products all taking advantage of a new technology platform (the cloud).

That’s not quite how I would describe what happened? As it grew, the ecosystem didn’t continue marching towards the vision that inspired it in its early years; it completely lost its bearings. The unifying experience that guided the original modern data stack—old tools, made easy—got replaced with a bunch of catchphrases about instant insights, better decisions, and data democratization—i.e., borderless financial markets, smart contracts, and [a decentralized internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIPSAvhiWuU). These ambitions dramatically expanded the modern data stack’s scope from streamlining how data teams were already working to transforming how entire companies should operate. 

But there was no agreement on *how *we’d do this. There was no visible picture of the collective experience the modern data stack was supposed to create for people who weren’t data practitioners. So, everyone tried to figure out how to “democratize data” or “empower decision-makers” on their own—and it turned into a mosh pit. Did documentation live in a BI tool or a data dictionary? In whichever one you were selling. Were we replacing spreadsheets, or integrating with them? Depends on if you thought you could compete with Excel. How would an executive know if they can trust the dashboard they’re looking at? By logging into your product, probably. There was no Schelling point to build towards; there were shills, pointing towards whatever thing they had built.

Moreover, we got distracted by circular problems of our own making. We created pipelines to shuffle data around, and orchestrators to coordinate those pipelines, and observability dashboards to monitor the orchestrators, and incident managers to organize the observability incidents. We weren’t just driving with no destination in mind; we also [got stuck in our own traffic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNOohFst9Lc&t=47s) on the way there.

Though the economics of the modern data stack were always tenuous,[^7] I don’t think that Jerome Powell or Sam Altman are who did us in.[^8] The problem was that the modern data stack’s ambitions expanded—from helping data teams to revolutionizing companies—with no communal vision for how to get there. There was money, and ambition, and loosely shared philosophy that favored SQL and the cloud, but there were [no answers to these questions](https://benn.substack.com/i/40271466/the-other-modern-data-stacks):

> It’s become popular to say that data teams should think of everything they create as a product, and the rest of their colleagues as their customers. To build on this idea, what should that product be? What should it feel like to go from question, through technology and tools, through collaboration and conversation, to an answer? 
> Our current solution, though full of pieces that are individually great, is a disjointed one. Some responsibilities, like metric governance, are shared across multiple tools; others, like tracking what happens after a question is answered, are [mostly ignored](https://benn.substack.com/p/big-whiff). Even seemingly basic questions, like "where do I first go to ask a question?," don't have clear answers. …
> How should it feel to use modern data stack? What can the system add up to? What’s the best way for people to answer an unfolding series of questions, to trust those answers, and to decide what to do next? What can we create for people who care about how well the modern data stack works, regardless of where the lines are drawn between products and services? 

If you want to go fast, the proverb says, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 

Modern data stack vendors chose speed, and never attempted to truly build something together. Companies built product integrations as a way to cross-sell, or to paper over feature gaps, or to ingratiate themselves with more successful vendors.[^9] But most partnerships were temporary and transactional agreements of mutual convenience that went [co-sponsored afterparty](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nvquanghuy_the-afterhour-parties-at-coalesce-dbt-labs-activity-7118231387601571840-0LG6/) deep.

One way or another, we weren’t going to last by going it alone. We were going to have to develop a coherent vision as a bunch of independent companies, or all get acquired and be handed that vision by a few big companies. So far, the latter seems to be winning.

—

Still, a bigger question remains: *Why* weren’t we able to produce a more coherent vision for what the modern data stack was supposed to become? Why has nobody been able to quite articulate *how* data products go beyond just streamlining self-referential workflows, and become the transformative strategic asset that they proudly proclaim to be? 

One answer is because they can’t. [Data may not have that revolutionary power](https://benn.substack.com/p/day-of-reckoning). It may simply be dryly utilitarian.

If that’s true, Tristan’s proposal for rebranding the modern data stack as the analytics stack would be a fitting coda. It both reorients the ecosystem back towards its original goals of serving the needs of practitioners and away from the buzzy neologisms that defined the last few years, and it has a sort of dull, workmanlike tone that will [bore thrill seekers](https://benn.substack.com/p/its-time-to-build) and attract [people who want to solve real problems](https://twitter.com/ejames_c/status/1739855465742540863). Whereas the modern data stack was expansive—it could be a boundless platform; it could shape-shift its way into being a critical part of the [$7 trillion dollar AI market](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0)[^10]—analytics is a function. It is [accounting](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-end-of-our-purple-era): Small and localized and bound. And [frugal](https://benn.substack.com/p/data-and-the-almighty-dollar#:~:text=Equivalent%20scenarios%20border%20on%20the%20absurd.):

> In what other departments do companies need to buy a wide collection of expensive tools, bought by different people and priced in different ways, to solve a single set of problems? Equivalent scenarios border on the absurd. Imagine needing to build a CRM for a nascent sales team, and having to buy a tool for logging phone calls, a tool for logging emails, a tool that stores these logs, a tool that helps sales reps see the status of their opportunities, a tool that helps sales leaders keep track of their team’s performance, and a tool to alert you when other tools break. While products like these may get hung off of Salesforce at some point, they’re bought by growing sales teams, not integral legs to an eight-legged stool. 

The other answer, however, is we simply built the modern data stack in the wrong way. It’s possible that the transformative potential of data is real; we just lost sight of how to get there amid the riot. If we can figure out that vision—if someone can reveal their dream to all of us, in a way so visceral we can dream it too—we can start chasing the same thing again, as we did a decade ago, when the dream was smaller. 

In other words, the bigger target—not just analytics, but organizational transformation—remains. The space got invaded by hordes of new companies, and economic shock is nuking a lot of them out of existence. [But the target remains.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64C6i-FgYXw)

# Lost in the sauce or lost in the game?

Another—also cynical—way to think about the modern data stack is through the eyes of the people who created it. In a recent post, Anu Atluru proposes that there are [two types of entrepreneurs](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/mission-or-game). Those [lost in the sauce and those lost in the game](https://www.vh1.com/news/fodyoz/zolas-story-twitter-epic-lines):

> There are those in it for the love of the mission that they’re obsessed with championing. And there are those in it for the love of the game of entrepreneurship itself, almost irrespective of the mission of the business. *Sometimes the mission is the business and sometimes the business is the mission. Type I, and Type II.*

The data world, I’d argue, has very few true mission-driven, Type I founders. At best, most data founders are motivated by bringing some elegance to an ugly technical problem; at worst, we were opportunists who convinced ourselves we could turn some [internal tool](https://benn.substack.com/p/internal-tools-make-lousy-startups) into a business, and saw founding a company as a way to avoid the career cul-de-sac of [becoming a mid-level data director](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-missing-analytics-executive#:~:text=Most%20people%20never%20make%20it.%20Companies%20rarely%20have%20data%20leaders%20that%20sit%20among%20those%20at%20the%20top%20of%20the%20org%20chart.%20Analysts%20are%20typically%20told%20to%20drop%20anchor%20just%20offshore%2C%20one%20step%20below%20the%20c%2Dsuite%2C%20buried%20underneath%20some%20other%20function%20and%20some%20other%20executive.%C2%A0). There aren’t many people who start data companies simply to manifest something in the world. For most of us, it’s important that *we* manifest it, either because we’ll have fun building it or because we want the rewards for doing so.

As Anu says, there’s nothing wrong with starting a company for those reasons; companies can exist for noble reasons, and they can exist to [make something great that makes a lot of money](https://benn.substack.com/p/your-companys-values-will-be-used/comment/49578725). Both are fine. 

However, type II founders aren’t great when an ecosystem needs to *collectively* build something great, which is what the modern data stack was. Had we all been chasing a mission, we might’ve figured out ways to help everyone get there. But when we’re mostly there for the game, we care more about the individual role we’re playing than the communal thing we’re building.

[^1]: Although, I think there’s a very real possibility that the Vision Pro becomes an [engulfing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kGdpdM-fIw) device. Because people are definitely going to get addicted to this thing, right? According to one review, wearing a Vision Pro is [like dreaming](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/should-you-buy-a-vision-pro-a-guide). You can conjure entire worlds—soon, [from nothing](https://openai.com/sora), literally, with [obvious implications](https://twitter.com/seconds_0/status/1758198179408068708)—and drown yourself in them. And, sure, [they may be nothing more](https://defector.com/the-problem-with-the-goggles-of-the-future-is-today) than “hollow imaginings meant to augment reality through a laminated veil of glass and sensors.” But what if your actual reality is already empty and isolated? What if detaching isn’t a downside, but exactly the point?If millions of people already sink themselves into our crude [Experience Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_machine)—drugs, porn, video games—and disappear, what hope do we have against the real thing?

[^2]: Well, sorta. I’ve never used a Vision Pro, so, ironically, I’m basing this entirely on what I’ve been told about it.

[^7]: And predictably so. From this blog, [in the fall of 2021](https://benn.substack.com/p/data-and-the-almighty-dollar#:~:text=And%20so%2C%20here%20we%20are.):The ecosystem is creating category after category, throwing out product after product. Thus far, the market has absorbed them—but the dynamic is unstable. With few dominant players and fewer agreed-upon categorical standards, customers are choosing from a large inventory of small companies, offering dozens of startups enough of a foothold to reasonably claim that they provide more value than they cost. Furthermore, because of the variance in buyers and business models, the true cost of the stack is amortized across different teams and obfuscated by irregular billing logistics. But data teams and IT departments have budgets. Even if every product is worth it on its own, the collective cost eventually becomes too much to bear. Something has to give.

[^8]: Here’s another way to ask this question. Had the economy stayed hot and ChatGPT stayed buried inside OpenAI, would the modern data stack, as it existed in 2021, have survived? My vote: No.

# LLMs shouldn’t write SQL

*There's no direct path from a business question to a useful query.*

---

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q4aU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2740d14d-dead-45e6-91de-02ec110193af_1242x914.png)

There are, very roughly, [two ways to analyze data](https://benn.substack.com/p/self-serve-still-a-problem#:~:text=They%20work%20like%20scientists):[^1]

> [ People can ] work like journalists, collating existing metrics and drawing conclusions by considering them in their totality. Rather than looking for new ways to assess a question, they start by asking, “how do we currently measure that?” [ Or they can ] work like scientists, creating new datasets and aggregating them in novel ways to draw conclusions about specific, nuanced hypotheses.

In business contexts, the first type of analysis typically consists of asking a series of Mad Lib-style questions about known metrics, like revenue retention or daily active users or ad spend, and aggregating and filtering those metrics by different dimensions. “Show me *total orders *in *Massachusetts *by *month *compared to* the same number from a year ago,*” someone might ask. This question will reveal something, like a spike in new orders in February. And that will prompt more questions of the same style—“now show me *total orders* in *Massachusetts* by *month* and by *product category*”—until people find whatever they’re looking for. 

These questions are often answered using BI tools. Most BI tools support this with more or less the same architecture. First, there’s some sort of data model in which people define metrics, how they should be calculated, and the ways they can be aggregated, filtered, and combined. And second, there’s an interface where people choose which metrics they want to see and how they want to aggregate, filter, and combine them. The former defines the structure of Mad Lib sentences and the words that people can choose to fill them in; the latter lets people fill them in and gives them tables and charts of their results.[^2] 

Though people can be combinatorially creative in how they complete their sentences, this approach puts guardrails around the sorts of questions that they can ask. You can’t fully improvise in a BI tool, and that’s the point—to let people ask questions, but make sure that whenever they make a chart of their company’s revenue, they’re using the correct formula for calculating it. 

The second method of analysis is less structured. It usually starts with a looser question—“was our [Super Bowl commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve2miT5iF2M) worth it?”—that can’t easily be answered with off-the-shelf metrics. Historically, these questions are answered by analysts who collect and clean new datasets and aggregate them up in some bespoke way. It’s unlikely, for example, that Dunkin’ Donuts’ has any [canonized KPIs](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/metrics) on [orange jumpsuit sales](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3QUnPmLK6p/) in their BI tool; instead, somewhere at Dunkin’ HQ, there’s probably an analyst who’s trying to braid together a bunch data on social media impressions, website visits, and donut sales in SF and Kansas City, not to create a dashboard, but to help the Dunkin’ CEO explain to his [private equity overlords](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/30/business/dunkin-inspire-acquisition/index.html) why the Bennifer reboot [was worth $30 million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYC0hsrRJWc).[^3] Because these questions require a lot of analytical offroading, they’re commonly answered using unstructured tools like Excel, or using open-ended languages like SQL and Python. 

Of course, this divide isn’t perfect; there are times when people use both approaches, and there are tools that try to offer hybrid solutions. But the split broadly works: Some analysis is done using code-free interfaces that generate SQL for you, and some analysis is done by people writing custom queries from scratch. Or, if you prefer a boxes and arrows:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fHHI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5b0d4d7-3856-41cf-bdc4-14a9c1f40006_1474x824.png)

Last month, Gartner predicted that [all of this is going to change](https://webinar.gartner.com/564576/agenda/session/1273063?login=ML)? I think?

> By 2025, use of natural language as a primary data management API will be the dominant interface leading to a 100x consumption of data across the ecosystem. …
> Natural language will replace SQL as the dominant query interface expanding access and use.

Well. As a vague prediction, sure—AI will [save humanity](https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/); it is the most transformative invention [since the printing press](https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/interview/ai-is-biggest-change-for-society-since-printing-revolution-top-expert-says/); [Nvidia](https://www.google.com/search?q=NVDA&sca_esv=ffe33ea245d4af43&rlz=1C5CHFA_en&sxsrf=ACQVn0_5W-3lS8zsHkRBrm0gSDooBK0T7g%3A1708623285806&ei=tYXXZfTaML_cptQPgb6Q6AE&ved=0ahUKEwi0iYXgvb-EAxU_rokEHQEfBB0Q4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=NVDA&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiBE5WREEyDRAAGIAEGA0YsQMYgwEyBxAAGIAEGA0yBxAAGIAEGA0yBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjIIEAAYFhgeGAoyBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeSJY9UPICWPs7cAN4AZABAJgBhQOgAa8EqgEHMC4xLjAuMbgBA8gBAPgBAfgBAsICChAAGEcY1gQYsAPCAg0QABiABBiKBRhDGLADwgIKECMYsQIYJxidAsICBxAjGLECGCfCAg0QABiABBgKGLEDGIMBwgIQEAAYgAQYigUYChixAxiDAeIDBRIBMSBAiAYBkAYK&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) is bigger than [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=alphabet+tiker&sca_esv=dfe26d33caab7b7d&rlz=1C5CHFA_en&sxsrf=ACQVn080jfPTfEYWVNsitf7FIq1xzoxV0Q%3A1708649326987&ei=buvXZcPsO-yhptQP3uiYEA&ved=0ahUKEwjD27jhnsCEAxXskIkEHV40BgIQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=alphabet+tiker&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDmFscGhhYmV0IHRpa2VyMgcQABiABBgNMggQABgHGB4YCjIIEAAYBRgeGA0yChAAGAUYHhgNGAoyCBAAGAUYHhgNMgoQABgFGB4YDRgKMgoQABgIGB4YDRgKMggQABgIGB4YDTIIEAAYCBgeGA0yCBAAGAgYHhgNSLYhUNYXWOYfcAJ4AZABAJgBvwGgAYIJqgEDMC43uAEDyAEA-AEBwgIKEAAYRxjWBBiwA8ICDRAAGIAEGIoFGEMYsAPCAhEQABiABBiKBRiRAhixAxiDAcICBxAAGIAEGAriAwUSATEgQIgGAZAGCg&sclient=gws-wiz-serp); Nvidia is bigger than the [American banking industry](https://companiesmarketcap.com/banks/largest-banks-by-market-cap/);[^4] Nvidia is bigger than [Spain](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/ESP); etc, etc, etc. If AI is going to eat the world, it'll probably eat SQL too.

But *how*? This is where things seem more complicated, and SQL—ever the technical zombie, always dying but never dead—seems more durable.

One possible answer is that natural language becomes the new interface for BI. Rather than dragging and dropping pills into drop zones, people could write their analytical Mad Libs—“compare *total sales *by *month *in *Boston and Charlotte* for the *‘[Fenway faithful](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRrPIqOA_Ws/)’ and ‘[Go Hornets](https://twitter.com/hornets/status/1612498480135561216)’ donuts*”—as sentences. For many people, this would be much more accessible than the [complex and crowded](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/the-tableau-desktop-workspace/get-to-know-tableau-desktop) interfaces that most BI tools have today.[^5] 

But! If this is how we use natural language to answer questions, it doesn’t replace SQL. In fact, these chatbots *probably won’t even write SQL*. Early [product development efforts](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/search-sage), [research papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07509.pdf), and a [handful](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/semantic-layer-as-the-data-interface) of [informal](https://delphihq.substack.com/p/delphi-at-100-dbt-semantic-layer) [studies](https://twitter.com/frasergeorgew/status/1760133028314329204) have consistently found that, even when asking these structured Mad Lib-style questions, LLMs don’t write particularly reliable SQL on their own[^6]—but they *can* figure out how to configure a BI tool based on a natural language question. Moreover, having the LLM sit on top of a data model, rather than outright replace it, protects against wild hallucinations, because the LLM is bound by the same guardrails that protect BI tools’ human users.

Put differently, if natural language is used for solving the first type of analytical problem, it will likely do so by putting a “natural language chatbot” box to the left of the BI box in the diagram above. People will ask it their questions; some LLM fine-tuned on schema documentation and business jargon will figure out how to express that question not as a query but as a series of inputs into a BI tool; the BI tool will generate the query.[^7] There’s no reason for the LLM to ever write a query directly.

That would make the Gartner prediction kind of weird? SQL would serve the same role in this world as it does in today’s; the LLM just updates how we generate that SQL. 

Which leads to the second way to interpret Gartner’s prediction—that LLMs replace the *second* way people do analysis. Natural language won’t just help people ask structured questions; it will also be the chosen way people do complex analysis too. It will, as Gartner says, “replace SQL as the dominant query interface.” Could AI do *that*?

Today, no? But [a](https://www.textql.com/) [huge](https://www.databricks.com/blog/whats-new-databricks-sql#:~:text=Databricks%20Assistant%3A%20Write%20better%20and%20faster%20SQL%20with%20natural%20language) [number](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/use-ai-snowflake-cortex/#:~:text=demo%20here.-,Text2SQL,-(in%20private%20preview) [of](https://julius.ai/) [companies](https://datagpt.com/) [are](https://www.seek.ai/blog/introducing-embedded-ai-data-analyst-powered-by-seek) [building](https://www.dataherald.com/) [AI](https://www.waii.ai/) [agents](https://www.text2sql.ai/) that turn questions into SQL queries. They are all doing lots of work figuring out how to write good queries; context-aware queries; queries trained on your data, on your documentation, on other SQL queries. And the consensus view seems to be that, eventually, because of this work and the unrelenting advancements in AI, LLMs will be able to write infinitely complex queries based on English prompts. 

But, with [all](https://towardsdatascience.com/can-llms-replace-data-analysts-building-an-llm-powered-analyst-851578fa10ce) [the](https://towardsdatascience.com/can-llms-replace-data-analysts-getting-answers-using-sql-8cf7da132259) [focus](https://blog.langchain.dev/llms-and-sql/) [on](https://iamnotarobot.substack.com/p/generating-sql-with-llms-for-fun) [figuring](https://patterns.app/blog/2023-01-18-crunchbot-sql-analyst-gpt) [out](https://towardsdatascience.com/can-chatgpt-write-better-sql-than-a-data-analyst-f079518efab2) *if* we can do this, we seem to be ignoring a more important question—do we *want *to?

Suppose you need to [draw an owl](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl). Today, with generative AI, it’s easy—just open up DALL-E or Midjourney or whatever new startup launched a stylized wrapper around DALL-E or Midjourney this week, and say, “draw an owl.” Seconds later, [you’ve got an owl](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/draw-an-owl.webp).

Now suppose you need to draw the owl at the top of this post. You're in the woods without a camera, and a baby owl, *that* baby owl, lands on a branch next to you and mugs at you with every ounce of outrage that it can muster. Amazing, you think; other people must see the owl. But you can’t just show them a generic owl, or some [imperfect tribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lK4cX5xGiQ) to your owl; they must see this owl, exactly as you see it, in all of its adorable, indignant splendor.

You could do this with AI too, but it would be really hard. [I couldn’t get close at all](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/draw-that-owl.webp):

> Draw an owl. It should be a baby owl. It's perched on a green mossy branch that should be barely visible in the lower left corner of the picture. The baby owl's body is facing slightly to our right, and its head is turned facing directly towards us. It's got a mix of brown and white feathers. Its eyes look angry, but the feathers underneath its beak are turned up slightly and look like a smile. The baby owl is in the foreground of the picture, and should be positioned in the left two-thirds of the frame. The background behind the baby owl is in the right third of the frame, and is mostly green and brown. We can't tell what is behind the owl because it's out of focus, but it's probably the woods. It is adorable.  

The problem with drawing an owl like this is that the axiom that “a picture is worth a thousand words” has a corollary: *It takes a thousand words to describe a picture. *And even that’s probably an understatement—[Nathaniel Hawthorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Hawthorne)[^8] could fill a book with words about that owl, and I doubt even he could ever get ChatGPT to recreate it.[^9] 

But AI could help me draw that owl in other ways. I could sketch the owl by hand, give my picture to ChatGPT, and ask it to make my drawing better, based on some English descriptions of the parts I couldn’t draw myself. I could upload pictures of other owls that [look](https://images.app.goo.gl/fZ5cDK15xJ4TMeUq9) [like](https://images.app.goo.gl/kAN7CS9sVNJBpfs57) [that](https://images.app.goo.gl/imTZuwKV1V1vffN19) [owl](https://images.app.goo.gl/zur72wqjeNVdpM178), and tell the bot how to use those pictures to improve its drawing. I could use a UI-based photo-editing tools, like Photoshop’s [Generative Fill](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/generative-fill.html) and Google’s [Magic Eraser](https://blog.google/products/photos/magic-eraser-android-ios-google-one/), that let me directly modify the picture ChatGPT produces without having to be terribly precise with my edits. Though I still wouldn’t be able to recreate an exact replica of that owl, I could get a lot closer using these inputs than I could with English alone. 

The obvious point here is that natural language isn’t always a particularly useful way to create something. For certain types of output, English is crude, imprecise, and painfully inefficient.

Now, instead of needing to drawing an owl, suppose you needed to write a formula in Excel that classifies a company into market segments by employee count:[^10]

ChatGPT can kinda do this. Asked to “write an Excel formula that categorizes cell A1, which contains the number of employees at a company, into one of three segments: Enterprise, Midmarket, and SMB,” [it produces this](https://chat.openai.com/share/b4a0f9e8-3d50-441b-b824-0a0c96a63ea3):

It’s close, but gets all the details wrong. It draws the line between SMB and Midmarket at 100 employees instead of 250; it rounds down, putting companies on the threshold between two segments in the smaller one instead of the larger one; it doesn’t handle cases when employee counts are zero, negative, or unknown. Though these issues are all fixable, it takes [more than 300 characters](https://chat.openai.com/share/90c050d0-2ceb-4c7a-8a4d-27c8000dd072) to explain them, compared to the 75 characters in the original Excel formula. And despite its length, the formula is also *more* precise—the English prompt doesn’t specify what should happen if A1 is a non-numeric value. 

Even for this tiny example, we can start to see the problem with doing analysis with natural language. There are thousands of computational devils in details like how to handle nulls. For analysts, describing these specifics in English is inefficient and inexact. For everyone else, they wouldn’t know they need to describe them at all.

To draw a baby owl, I don’t want to describe it, adjective by adjective; I want to crudely sketch it, and use AI to forgive my unsteady hand. To create a numbered list in a Google Doc, I don’t want to open an AI wizard, and type “list,” and have it say “It looks like you want to create a list of things! I can help with that. Would you like a bulleted list or a numbered list?,” and then type “number;” I want to push a button or use a hotkey. And I don’t want to describe, in anemic, gingerbread English, the precise and complex series of joins and functions that I need to perform to create a one-off measure of brand engagement around a sixty-second Super Bowl spot. I want to write code. Sort of.

The precision and compactness of code comes with a tradeoff: It’s tedious to write. There are small things that are annoying to do, and computers are finicky with details, like forgotten parentheses and misplaced commas. When analysts write SQL queries (and probably when an engineer writes code, but their dark arts [remain a mystery to me](https://twitter.com/bennstancil/status/1760010947907772773)), part of the work is staring blankly at the ceiling, trying to figure out what you want to do, and part of the work is writing actual queries that do the thing you want. And the second part is constrained by the tedium of remembering how functions work, and typing out long case statements, and trying to figure out how to do some stats thing that you know how to do in R but don’t know how to do in SQL. 

Ideally, analysts wouldn’t have to do any of this. Ideally, they could write something akin to [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode). Sketch the structure; hand-wave past the syntactic details. 

If AI is going to help with the second type of analysis, this is how I hope it does it—not by answering English questions, or even by authoring entire queries from a single prompt, but by letting me mash up poorly-written SQL and English in one mixed medium sketch. Like how I want to use a bad drawing of an owl to create a good one, I want to use a bad query to help me write a good query. Let me be precise about the details that matter, outline the ones that don’t, and ask the big-brained supercomputer figure out it all fits together.[^11] 

In other words, LLMs as a better interface to data models and semantic layers are great. LLMs as a Eucharistic for transubstantiating sketches of queries into real ones are great. But LLMs as an analyst, turning novel business questions into full queries? [Seems unwise.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Wise_Old_Owl)

# Modern data blowback

The investigation into whether or not the modern data stack is dead or alive continues. After Tristan [shivved it two weeks ago](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/is-the-modern-data-stack-still-a)—“Et tu, dbt?”—others have weighed in, declaring it some mix of [dead](https://joereis.substack.com/p/everything-ends-my-journey-with-the), [alive](https://www.blef.fr/modern-data-stack-disappearing/), or in need of being [reanimated under a new brand](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ole-olesen-bagneux_moderndatastack-postmodern-activity-7165013991843381248-4O67/).

Before we tire of this debate too much, I have one more comment. In [his post about the topic](https://www.blef.fr/modern-data-stack-disappearing/),  Christophe Blefari[^12] pointed out that we seem to be getting hung up on the name, and particularly the “modern” part. Should we move on from the term, so that we’re can stop pretending that something that’s ten years old is still new?

Like, no? At this point, the phrase is useful as a historical marker, and as a label for the data industry’s recent boom and bust cycle. It’s our [dot-com era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_company), or [Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0), or [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) (or, even more analogously, our [modern art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_art) era). It’s not a literal description of how new something is, or of the version of the world wide web we’re using; it’s an epochal delimiter. And in that sense, it’s a very useful shorthand. 

The interesting question, then, isn’t if we should retire the *term; *it’s if we should retire the prevailing philosophies associated with the term.

I think the early verdict is, kinda? Of my four major tenets of the modern data stack, we should probably keep a few and ditch at least one:

Undoubtedly, as the bubble bursts, as everyone moves on to AI, and as people get bored with the old thing, [some new set of philosophies](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-new-philosophers) will replace these. And some clever marketer will brand it with a new term. Which, sure, great, let’s do it. But I’d argue that the modern data stack has a well-understood [descriptivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description) meaning at this point; no reason to muddy those relatively clarified waters. 

# Some personal-ish news

Last week, I shared Anu Atluru’s theory of [Type I and Type II entrepreneurs](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/mission-or-game): 

> There are those in it for the love of the mission that they’re obsessed with championing. And there are those in it for the love of the game of entrepreneurship itself, almost irrespective of the mission of the business. *Sometimes the mission is the business and sometimes the business is the mission. Type I, and Type II.*

There's probably a parallel version of this theory for politicians. Some people run for office because their mission is ambition and success; some people’s ambition is the success of their mission. Unfortunately for all of us, most politicians seem to be in the first category, willing to sell their beliefs for the sake of their careers. 

My brother—some of you may know him, from his [very prominent presence on Twitter](https://twitter.com/whstancil)—is the most firm member of the second category that I know. He has strong opinions, genuinely held, and will fight relentlessly for them, regardless of [who they offend](https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1750999948366069771) or how little they help him personally. Say what you will about his particular political beliefs, he’s the sort of person that we need more of in politics.

This week, he announced that [he’s running for a seat](https://twitter.com/whstancil/status/1760433903943451075) in the Minnesota House of Representatives. It’s a small campaign, and every contribution to it helps. If you believe in [what he believes in](https://twitter.com/whstancil/status/1760434585572368515)—and if you want fewer people in politics fighting for their careers and more people fighting for a mission—[become a supporter](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/willforhouse).

If you:

venture capitalists will care about these things in this order: 

Of course, this is not what venture capitalists will say. They will likely clutch their pearls and bemoan your wickedness—your [bank heist](https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/the-lessons-google-ventures-learned-from-secret/); your behavior [unbecoming of a Founder](https://www.saastr.com/tech-and-startups-have-changed-do-founders-still-come-last/)—but they will also be intrigued by your guile, and probably hope that you call them if you found something else. 

This isn’t a statement about values, or what’s right or wrong; it is just what will happen. Take, for example, Johnny Boufarhat, the founder and CEO of Hopin, which [was liquidated this week](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/hopin-liquidates-u-k-business-relocates-headquarters-to-u-s). 

Hopin [launched in December of 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpErMqMyNN4) as a “live online events platform that replicates an in-person event.” On the day of its launch, it was a neat alternative to the sterile broadcast-style webinar, and a bet that virtual conferences might gradually become more popular. Four months after its launch—in an unbelievable stroke of luck for Hopin, and an unbelievable stroke of misfortune for the rest of us—Hopin was, quite literally, life-saving technology that was all but mandated by the CDC.[^1]

Everyone went berserk.[^2] Hopin raised [$6.5 million](https://wf.hopin.com/blog/hopin-raises-65-million-to-launch-the-future-of-events) in February of 2020; then [$40 million](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/hopin-raises-40m-series-a-as-its-virtual-events-business-accelerates/) four months later; then [$125 million](https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/) in five months later; then [$400 million](https://hopin.com/hopin-events/blog/announcing-our-series-c-whats-next-for-hopin) four months later; then [$450 million](https://hopin.com/hopin-events/blog/hopin-series-d-from-events-to-experiences) five months later. In those eighteen months, they went from [1,800 customers](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/virtual-events-start-up-hopin-raises-125m-at-a-2b-valuation.html) to more than [100,000](https://hopin.com/hopin-events/blog/hopin-series-d-from-events-to-experiences). The company’s valuation ballooned to [as high as $7.75 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/05/virtual-events-startup-hopin-valued-at-7-75-billion.html). At some point during those later rounds—which were [oversubscribed](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005239/en/Hopin-Announces-LinkedIn-as-Latest-Strategic-Investor-and-Partner), meaning investors wanted to buy more shares than were available to sell—Boufarhat sold about 20 percent of his shares for [roughly $150 million](https://www.ft.com/content/3472e2db-717f-4c7a-9d65-c1c461c79870).

Then, predictably, the pandemic ended. And, predictably, virtual events were no longer the booming business that they were when in-person events had been illegal. And, predictably, a [generationally large tech bubble](https://www.meritechcapital.com/benchmarking/historical-trading-data/ev-ntm-revenue) burst. And, not entirely predictably but not exactly surprisingly, Hopin fell apart, sold for [$50 ](https://www.crn.com/news/networking/ringcentral-to-pay-50m-for-startup-hopin-s-events-management-assets)*[million](https://www.crn.com/news/networking/ringcentral-to-pay-50m-for-startup-hopin-s-events-management-assets)*[ in 2023](https://www.crn.com/news/networking/ringcentral-to-pay-50m-for-startup-hopin-s-events-management-assets), and, a few days ago, [shut down its primary business](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/virtual-events-hopin-liquidation-vc).[^3] And, predictably, venture capitalists are accusing Boufarhat as [making out like a bandit](https://www.saastr.com/tech-and-startups-have-changed-do-founders-still-come-last/), and being for being a “founder put themselves first, above everyone else. Like at WeWork.”[^4]

Ok, but, WeWork? Weird example to scare us straight. Yes, WeWork raised more than $20 billion, and yes, Adam Neumann kept close to $2 billion for himself as the company spiraled into spectacular bankruptcy. But Adam Neumann recently raised [$350 million](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/a16z-chris-dixon-adam-neumann-flow-funding-disrupt-2022/) from a16z for another company! And famed investor Marc Andreessen said [they weren’t writing](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/15/business/dealbook/adam-neumann-flow-new-company-wework-real-estate.html) the “largest individual check Andreessen Horowitz has ever written in a round of funding” *despite* WeWork, but *because of* WeWork!

> Adam, and the story of WeWork, have been exhaustively chronicled, analyzed, and fictionalized – sometimes accurately. For all the energy put into covering the story, it’s often under appreciated that only one person has fundamentally redesigned the office experience and led a paradigm-changing global company in the process: Adam Neumann. We understand how difficult it is to build something like this and we love seeing repeat-founders build on past successes by growing from lessons learned. For Adam, the successes and lessons are plenty and we are excited to go on this journey with him and his colleagues building the future of living.

So Boufarhat, if he so chooses, will surely have a chance for a second act.[^5] Like Neumann. And like Parker Conrad, who started Zenefits, quickly grew it to a [$4.5 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/zenefits-rising-hrs-hottest-startup-just-raised-500-million-at-a-4-5-billion-valuation/) valuation, [nuked it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2016/02/08/zenefits-ceo-parker-conrad-resigns-amid-scandal/?sh=35f84be38314), and [had](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/rippling) [no](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-series-a-pitch-deck-and-memo) [problem](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-series-b-funding) [raising](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-raises-250m-in-series-c-funding) [money](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-raises-250m-in-series-d-funding) [again](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-raises-500m-in-series-e-funding). And even like David Byttow, who founded Secret, sold $3 million in a secondary sale (the sale that one VC called a bank heist), shut the company down, started a new one, and then [raised $1 million dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/07/bold/) from one of Secret’s biggest investors.

Because, for all of the hand-wringing on Sand Hill Road about this stuff, Silicon Valley is really just about making money. Investors don't invest in nice people; they invest in monetizable people. Proving your financial worth matters a lot more than proving your moral worth, to the point that I'm sure some investors like Neumann *more* for his [savvy dismantling of SoftBank](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-02-06/adam-neumann-wants-we-back). And there are probably some investors who also look at Byju Raveendran—who founded edtech startup Byju’s, raised tons of money, oversaw its collapse, and has invested [more than $1 billion of his own money](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/byjus-investors-call-for-egm-to-remove-founder-following-rights-issue/) into trying to save it—and don’t see a upstanding fighter, but an unserious patsy who’s being undone by his own pride. 

Still, it *is* hard to shake the sense that there is some sort of ethical dilemma here. It *[feels](https://twitter.com/bennstancil/status/1760010281923588208)*[ more complicated](https://twitter.com/bennstancil/status/1760010281923588208) than “whatever, it's fine, sell your shares whenever.” Right?

As a brief explainer, most secondary sales typically go something like this: Say one person starts a company, creates 80 shares in total, and grants them all to themselves.[^6] When they want to raise money, they might decide to sell 20 percent of the company for $20 million dollars, which would value the startup at $100 million. For a variety of reasons, rather than selling 20 percent of the existing shares, the company will create 20 shares out of thin air, and sell them to the investor for one million dollars each. Now, there are 100 shares, with the investor owning 20 percent and the founder owning 80 percent, with each share valued at one million dollars. 

Next, suppose that the company gets hot. Lots of people want to invest, and the market—i.e., the price that most investors are willing to pay—values the company’s shares at roughly six times their previous valuation, or $6 million a share. Two desirable investors might want to each buy 15 to 20 percent of the company at that price, and the company would like to take money from both of them. The company could create 50 more shares—for a total of 150—and sell 25 to each investor at $6 million a share, raising $150 million from each one. The founder would still have 80 shares, or 53 percent; the first investor would have 20 shares, or 13 percent; both of the second investors would have 25 shares, or 17 percent each. 

But there’s a problem with this: It dilutes the founder and the first investor by a third. Prior to the fundraise, the first investor owned 20 percent of the company; now, they only own 13 percent. Given how hot the company is, they probably want to raise less money and keep a larger share. And the prospective investors are unlikely to buy smaller amounts—say, eight percent each instead of 17 percent—because VCs typically don’t want to invest in companies if they can’t acquire a meaningful stake. 

One potential solution—and by far the most common one—is to reject one of the two investors. Create only 25 new shares instead of 50, sell them all to one investor for $150 million, and tell the other investor that you’d love to have them involved in the next round.[^7] 

But a second solution is for existing shareholders to sell some of their shares directly to the second investor. In this case, the company still creates 25 shares, and sells them to the first investor for $150 million. And then other shareholders—most likely the founder—sell 25 of their shares to the second investor for another $150 million. 

In both cases, the company ends up in the exact same spot: It’s valued at $750 million dollars; there are 125 outstanding shares worth $6 million each; it has $150 million in the bank; the first investor owns 20 out of 125 total outstanding shares, or 16 percent of the company. The only material difference between the two scenarios is that, in the second case, the founder has $150 million.

And that’s bad, because, as Jason Lemkin says, the founders will be [checked out](https://www.saastr.com/considered-fair-happy-medium-secondary-amount-founders-take-off-table-series-b-vc-funding-round/)? I think?

I have so many questions, but let's start with this one—if you founded a company, raised money from venture capitalists, and then won $150 million in a lottery, is it unethical for you to cash in the winning ticket? 

I mean, I guess you *could* argue that it is? At some point before you won the lottery, you probably promised your investors that you were on a mission to create a big, industry-defining company. You probably told them that you were an ambitious builder with a proven track record of success, showed them a [five-year plan](https://www.saastr.com/is-it-now-triple-triple-triple-double-double-double-t3d3-for-top-tier-saas-startups-probably/) for growing your company into a billion-dollar unicorn, and said that they were singularly committed to doing everything they could to make everyone involved—you, their team, and themselves—very wealthy. 

And if you were suddenly $150 million richer, you’re changing the terms of the deal? When you took their money, you were relatively poor. That poverty made you desperate; that desperation made you hungry; that hunger made you a useful vehicle for highly-speculative capital deployment. If you cash in your lottery ticket, the first part of that won’t be true—you will be rich and not poor—and the second part *might* not be true—you could become a satiated fat cat with a house in Cabo San Lucas, [wasting away in Margaritaville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrF4nF8VUb4). And because you raised money on the implicit promise that your startup was the thing that could take you from being poor to being extraordinarily wealthy, and because, if you have a $150 million dollars, your startup can only take them from being extraordinarily wealthy to dynastically wealthy, you have a moral duty to turn it down. 

Like, someone could argue that, but nobody would? Because it would be insane? Your investors might be quietly bummed if you hit the Mega Millions jackpot, and they may have a conversation with you about how motivated you are to continue working long and taxing hours, but surely they would never go so far as to say that you* *owe it to them to light your light the ticket on fire, because not doing so could, in indirect and hypothetical ways, harm their investment? Making that argument would not only require a VC to believe that founders are a kind of indentured servant, and that investors have a perpetual claim on their labor until they pay it back with sufficient time or a sufficient exit; nor would it just require believing that founders should maximize their investors’ returns over their own; it would also require believing that founders should *maximize their incentives* to maximize their investors’ returns. It is not enough for a founder to merely want their startup to succeed; they have to *need* it to succeed.  

And that seems wrong? Like capital W-wrong? In effect, it’s telling someone that they have an obligation to throw away a winning lottery ticket because it could change the odds that their ticket is a winner too. But—and this is a real question, not a troll—how is pressuring founders not to sell secondary shares, when, as in the toy example above, the round is oversubscribed and it has no material effect on the balance sheet of the business, not doing the same thing? 

The easy answer, I suppose, is that secondary sales are undeserved. The company isn’t big enough or durable enough to justify the founder making money on it yet. I guess, but winning the lottery would be pretty undeserved too? And also, are secondary sales *that* undeserved? Boufarhat, for example, created something big that the people valued at $150 million dollars, and sold it to “[willing buyers at the current fair market price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhy7JUinlu0&t=511s).”[^8] When Bill Ackman top-ticked a market in 2023, the All-In podcast—VCs, all of them, and as representative of elite Silicon Valley opinion as anyone—hailed him as [the investor of the year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT4ejH4ZfF4&t=2744s). If the money he made from selling an overvalued asset to consenting counterparties is worthy of a Bestie, why is Boufarhat’s sale of an overvalued asset to consenting counterparties morally reprehensible?[^9] That’s not to say every free-market transaction is fair and just, but shouldn’t those of us who work in the venture capital ecosystem, of all places, at least default to accepting the market as the arbiter of what is?

Moreover, we seem to selectively choose how to view rich founders. On one hand, if founders make a bunch of money through secondary sales, they risk becoming lazy and unfocused. But if founders *have* a bunch of money, we will eagerly write them checks. Former Salesforce CEO Bret Taylor, [who](https://www.businessinsider.com/quip-ceo-bret-taylor-750-million-salesforce-acquisition-2016-8) [probably](https://www.shopify.com/news/a-board-member-taylor-made-for-shopify) [isn’t](https://openai.com/blog/sam-altman-returns-as-ceo-openai-has-a-new-initial-board) [poor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/06/15/facebook-cto-bret-taylor-to-leave-company/), raised [$110 million dollars](https://fortune.com/2024/02/13/bret-taylor-clay-bavor-ai-startup-sierra-110-million-funding-sequoia-benchmark/) in one round for his new startup. Elon Musk—the literal richest man in the world—will have no problem raising money for his [$6 billion dollar](https://www.ft.com/content/28983bdc-2a38-4103-beae-08d9542ab69d) AI startup. And while there’s lots to question about Sam Altman’s effort to raise [$7 trillion dollars for his AI factories](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0), nobody is saying they won’t invest because they’re afraid he’ll get distracted by the casual [half-billion dollars](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sam-altman-set-one-biggest-235958808.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACBKEqb4jj3GhcGhKRWQHf30FFNbk15L3LMojdQDGc4q9JBOdapVeZ_oObdI_CzYcy-54QG0Oja7FZZ2QIFPv__JKX7VqIVWGggWgGPpSmt-K8_QFo0XI7Q-leUYTNS-CPbnSQiWwAbygrPaGpTO5m7e8ETxAfUxYMyDTp3tK4Ax) he’s going to make from the Reddit IPO. Again, this isn’t to say that money isn’t a powerful incentive; it’s to say that “money is demotivating” is, at best, inconsistently and opportunistically applied. 

Another argument people could make against secondary sales is that, as a founder, you owe it to your investors to not take the money. As Lemkin says, “they took a huge bet on you. That used to be a big deal.” They have your back and you should have theirs. “Founders that put themselves last like this, I put first. I’ll have their backs forever. No matter what the outcome or returns.”

But is that argument not [self-impeaching](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/09/politics/pelosi-congress-impeachment-trump/index.html)? How can a VC simultaneously discourage a founder from cashing in a $150 million dollar lottery ticket—because it might, hypothetically, distract them from maximizing the value of the VC’s investment—say, in the same breath, that they will always have the founder’s back, no matter their own returns? 

Ultimately, rightly or wrongly, most VCs are going to make decisions that protect their investment over a founder’s financial well-being. Sure, they will support their honorable founders as professional friends, making introductions, posting nice things on LinkedIn, and [offering their drive-by advice](https://benn.substack.com/i/138945895/good-vc-bad-vc-useful-vc). But in more material ways—like writing checks, structuring investment terms, and [deciding when to fire a founder](https://reactionwheel.net/2021/11/your-boards-of-directors-is-probably-going-to-fire-you.html)—well, that’s business.

Which, fair! It is business! But then should secondary sales not be judged by the same financial ruler, and not an ethical one?

The final main argument against secondary sales, which Lemkin also mentions in his post,[^10] is that they’re unfair to the company’s employees. Most people join startups because they believe in the company’s potential and the future value of its equity; if founders check out—which, again, is a hypothetical—they’re defaulting on their promises to the people who are gambling the most on the company’s success. 

Which isn’t exactly an argument against founders’ selling; it’s an argument—and a very convincing one—against what founders do after they sell. But founders can work hard for their employees and investors—chase a big, industry-defining company, keep their [T2D3 plan](https://www.saastr.com/is-it-now-triple-triple-triple-double-double-double-t3d3-for-top-tier-saas-startups-probably/), remain singularly committed to doing everything they can to make everyone involved very wealthy—whether or not they’re keeping time with a Casio or a [disco ball made of diamonds](https://www.thewatchpages.com/watches/jacob-co-the-mystery-sn80030bdaaa/).

Still, I understand the perception. If I worked at Hopin, and found out that Boufarhat had taken home $150 million in secondary sales, would I be upset? My guess is yes, though perhaps not because he sold, but because he either sold and disappeared, which there’s no evidence that he did, or because he sold some of his shares and didn’t give me a chance to sell some of mine too. 

The good news is that this suggests a possible resolution to all of this: Secondary sales are fine, so long as everyone in the company is told about them. Give employees an implicit veto over selfish and undeserved sales, by subjecting them to the court of public opinion.

The most useful heuristic I ever found for making backroom decisions was this: Assume everyone will find out. Assume the decision is public, in Slack, on Twitter, and written up in *The Verge. *Assume that, partly because it may well be public one day,[^11] and mostly because it will compel you to do the right* *thing. “You can lie to yourself and your minions; you can claim that you haven't a qualm; [but you never can run from nor hide what you've done](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/technology/a-founder-of-secret-the-anonymous-social-app-shuts-it-down-as-use-declines.html#:~:text=The%20founders%20did%20not%20initially%20tell%20the%20employees%20about%20the%20sale%3B%20instead%2C%20some%20of%20them%20found%20out%20on%20Secret.) from [the eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4COfl8DMB8&t=247s)” of your employees.[^12]

So if you’re a VC, let people sell. But let employees, who aren’t just betting one piece of their portfolio on their executives but their entire careers, decide if a sale will cause them to check out. Let employees, who are logging the hours, decide if it’s fair that leaders got to sell and they didn’t.[^13] And let employees, who have a better appreciation of a founder’s work—or lack thereof—than anyone, decide how much they’ve earned. 

# Some personal-ish news

To address the obvious question that some of you may have: Yes, I sold some Mode shares in a secondary sale; no, it wasn’t nearly as much as any of the sales that make the news (or nearly as much as many of the sales that don’t); no, I didn’t announce it to the company because these things tend to be done quietly by default, though in hindsight, I think that would’ve been the right thing to do; yes, I probably wish I could’ve sold more. 

I would’ve sold more for one primary reason: If you gambling at a casino for years, with all of your chips on the table the whole time, the stress will eventually eat you alive. Nothing is more terrifying than knowing you could still walk out a loser; nothing will [burn you out faster](https://twitter.com/spamaps/status/1523823022779420673) than wondering if your payout for years of work will be years of regret. Like, sure, stay motivated; stay ambitious; all of the clichés. But there’s a fine line between being hungry and being starved, and you’ll make good decisions and be a good leader on only one side of it.

[^1]: Or, as TechCrunch put it [in a staggering understatement](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/hopin-raises-40m-series-a-as-its-virtual-events-business-accelerates/), “COVID-19 was an accelerant for Hopin, it appears.”

[^2]: “Life's too short to not go for broke, so everybody, *everybody*, go [berzerk](https://genius.com/Eminem-berzerk-lyrics#:~:text=go%0ASay%2C%20%22Fuck%20it!%22%20before%20we%20kick%20the%20bucket-,Life%27s%20too%20short%20to%20not%20go%20for%20broke,-So%20everybody%2C%20everybody%20(Go%20berzerk)%0AGet%20your%20vinyls).”

[^3]: Though this was probably also predictable, since I’ve heard rumors that one of Hopin’s major late-stage investors pitched hot companies by promising that they’d do very little diligence before they offered them a term sheet.

[^4]: Oh, and what a time we hadI drunk the drinks, I shook the handsAnd I believed the plan, ohBut it broke my heart in 150 million ways.([New Griff!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0FrsjtmK4k) Leave this dumb blog! Go listen!)

[^5]: Eh, maybe. Investors may actually see Boufarhat’s initial success as nothing more than an incredibly good luck, since started a company that perfectly timed and was perfectly positioned to monetize [the biggest global event of at least the last two decades](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F0cqt90,%2Fm%2F030q7,%2Fg%2F11j2cc_qll,%2Fm%2F01kmd4,%2Fm%2F09889g&hl=en). That one is gonna be hard to run back.

[^6]: This entire bit is an oversimplification that ignores option pools, share classes, and a bunch of other complications, but close enough.

[^7]: [“It’s a bit too early for us, but we’ll be rooting for you from the field.”](https://hunterwalk.medium.com/when-a-vc-passes-and-is-wrong-real-talk-between-me-and-ethenas-ceo-roxanne-petraeus-3f79fdc56fc1)

[^8]: *Margin Call* is a bit of a cult movie in Silicon Valley, and Jeremy “Sell it all!” Irons is the hero, not Kevin “Yes, but at what cost?” Spacey.

[^9]: Of course, if he torpedoed the company after selling, sure, that’s different. But there’s no evidence that he did, and he only sold 20 percent of his shares. At least eighty percent of his paper net worth was still tied in Hopin equity.

[^10]: Well, sort of. Lemkin does say that the team should comes first, but kind of contradicts this point by never explaining why secondary sales are bad for them, and only talking about why they’re bad for investors. “The investors make nothing, the product is in trouble, and yet the founder cashed out $100m+ and moved to the beach in Spain.” (In the [linked podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzt_o-eD_0Q), he mentions tender offers for employees, but he still says it's investors who are getting abused.) And that kind of gives away the game, doesn't it? No matter what investors say, they’re mostly focused on their return.

[^11]: For example, one of our lawyers physically mailed Mode’s entire capitalization table to the wrong employee’s house.

[^12]: [Like I said](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-problem-was-the-product#footnote-4-141735665), a banger.

[^13]: [And let them sell too?](https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/30/the-secret-about-rich-founders-and-ferraris/) Boards typically don’t allow this, but if founders had to tell employees about secondary sales, things would probably move toward a more inclusive equilibrium.

*Snowshovel.*

One day, the urge to [spend more time with your family](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/23/business/23family.html) comes [for us all](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-modern-data-stack-was-never-big-enough#:~:text=Frank%20Slootman%20comes%20for%20data%20companies). 

Last week, Frank Slootman [stepped down from his role as CEO](https://www.snowflake.com/news/sridhar-ramaswamy-named-chief-executive-officer-of-snowflake/) of Snowflake. Slootman, the Rihanna of Silicon Valley CEOs—a [proven hitmaker](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/02/01/the-outsider/), [ostensibly retired](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/30/snowflake-ceo-frank-slootman-pursues-third-ipo.html#:~:text=After%20stepping%20down%20as%20ServiceNow%20CEO%20in%202017%2C%20he%20was%20retired%20and%20plenty%20wealthy), but [available for hire](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/03/03/rihanna-performance-jamnagar-anant-ambani-wedding/72830263007/) for [the right price](https://fortune.com/2020/12/04/snowflake-ceo-frank-slootman-salary-net-worth/)[^1]—said that [the company will be fine](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/29/snowflakes-slootman-not-worried-about-exodus-not-a-personal-cult.html) without him. Wall Street [hated it](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/snowflake-says-frank-slootman-is-retiring-as-ceo-stock-plunges-20percent.html). Content farmers [made threads](https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1763277616172175757) about it. Databricks missed their chance to [make a funny commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rx7-ec0p0A).[^2]

And Snowflake [announced](https://www.snowflake.com/news/sridhar-ramaswamy-named-chief-executive-officer-of-snowflake/) that their new CEO will be Sridhar Ramaswamy:

> Since joining Snowflake in May 2023 in connection with the company’s acquisition of Neeva, the world’s first private AI powered search engine, Ramaswamy has been spearheading Snowflake’s AI strategy. He led the launch of Snowflake Cortex, Snowflake’s new fully managed service that makes AI simple and secure for all users to quickly drive business value. Prior to joining Snowflake, Ramaswamy co-founded Neeva in 2019.

Two years ago, Snowflake’s ambitions seemed clear: Be Oracle. Be the next dominant data warehouse vendor. [Be boring](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-end-of-big-data), but in the best sort of way—by predictably generating [$10 billion to $15 billion of profit every year](https://companiesmarketcap.com/oracle/earnings/). Turn [Snowflake Summit](https://www.snowflake.com/summit/) into the next [Oracle OpenWorld](https://www.oracle.com/openworld/); conquer the ballooning market for [enterprise data management](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/report/database-management); drink Larry Ellison’s [$140 billion milkshake](https://www.forbes.com/profile/larry-ellison/) (and, probably, [beat](https://www.latitude38.com/lectronic/frank-slootman-rorc-transatlantic-race/) his [sailing team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Team_USA) too). 

Now, that goal might be changing? Slootman—who built his fortune and reputation on being a [ruthless businessman](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/frank-slootman-saw-ceo-role-214631307.html)—is being replaced by a [former ML and AI engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sridhar_Ramaswamy).[^3] Though I’m sure that Ramaswamy will continue to invest in Snowflake’s meat-and-potatoes warehouse business, it’s hard not to interpret the choice as the soft launch of a new priority, as a gentle reboot, as a trickle-down pivot, all towards the AI supernova. An engineer from Nvidia [reacted to the news](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7169021018550853636/):

> I was hosting Snowflake's Cortex team at NVIDIA HQ when the news broke that AI Legend Sridhar Ramaswamy would be replacing the Enterprise General Frank Slootman. …
> This is a truly exciting time. AI is eating the world and will soon consume the enterprise in particular. We at NVIDIA have known this for years and Snowflake's leadership change signals in very clear terms that they too are serious about revolutionizing the enterprise with AI.

For the last 18 months, the tech world has been hyperventilating about AI. [Thirty percent](https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-startup-funding-continues-drop-despite-ai-frenzy-2024-01-11/) of all U.S. venture funding went to AI companies in 2023. Earlier stage companies have an even more extreme skew, with AI companies making up [60 percent](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/what-we-can-learn-from-ai-startups-in-y-combinators-latest-batch) of Y Combinator’s recent cohorts. [The 100x multiples are back.](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-search-startup-perplexity-set-to-double-valuation-to-1-billion-b84be204) Elon Musk is raising [$6 billion](https://www.ft.com/content/28983bdc-2a38-4103-beae-08d9542ab69d) for his AI company; Sam Altman is raising [$7 ](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0)*[trillion](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0)*[ for his](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0).[^4] 

On one hand, this is normal enough—venture capitalists are prone to irrational exuberance;[^5] it’s kind [of](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/13/business/a-gold-rush-from-software-reinvigorates-silicon-valley.html) [their](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/17/business/media/17bubble.html) [whole](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/technology/in-silicon-valley-partying-like-its-1999-again.html) [thing](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/19/technology/tech-startup-funding.html). If AI is indeed a bubble—and [there are rumblings](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/nvidia-stock-price-bubble-worries-73d7b8d1)—it won’t be the first time that Silicon Valley overfunded an immature and unproven technology.

On the other hand, there is at least one very notable difference between the AI circus and prior technological megatrends, including both successes like the cloud and the internet itself, and disappointments like the metaverse and the web3 carnival: This time, it’s not just startups that are betting the house on the [new new thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_New_Thing). 

Ramaswamy's promotion at Snowflake is just one example of an established company declaring themselves all in on AI. Meta is spending tens of billions of dollars [on AI investments](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/18/mark-zuckerberg-indicates-meta-is-spending-billions-on-nvidia-ai-chips.html).[^6] Alphabet CEO Sudhar Pichai [is under fire](https://stratechery.com/2024/gemini-and-googles-culture/#:~:text=That%2C%20by%20extension%2C%20must%20mean%20removing%20those%20who%20let%20the%20former%20run%20amok%2C%20up%20to%20and%20including%20CEO%20Sundar%20Pichai.) for botching the Gemini release, and people are wondering if Google—a company that makes [$240 billion](https://abc.xyz/assets/43/44/675b83d7455885c4615d848d52a4/goog-10-k-2023.pdf) from ads, and manages a half-dozen products with billions of users each—should discard [the person who used to run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai) Search, Chrome, Gmail, Google Drive, and Android and replace him with someone who’s done none of that, [but is an AI expert](https://twitter.com/AravSrinivas/status/1762009992381845506). In 2017, just as Bitcoin was hitting [its first peak](https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin+price&rlz=1C5CHFA_en&oq=bitcoin+price&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqDggAEEUYJxg7GIAEGIoFMg4IABBFGCcYOxiABBiKBTINCAEQABiDARixAxiABDISCAIQABgUGIMBGIcCGLEDGIAEMhAIAxAAGIMBGLEDGIAEGIoFMg0IBBAAGIMBGLEDGIAEMg0IBRAAGIMBGLEDGIAEMg0IBhAAGIMBGLEDGIAEMgYIBxBFGDzSAQgyNTg1ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), AWS CEO Andy Jassey said [he didn’t see any need](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/dont-expect-aws-to-launch-a-blockchain-service-anytime-soon/) for Amazon to build blockchain services yet. We don’t “build technology because we think it is cool,” he said. With AI, Amazon’s tone changed: Amid the OpenAI-inspired chatbot craze, [AWS released Q](https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/11/aws-announces-amazon-q-to-reimagine-the-future-of-work), a generative AI-powered assistant that will “reimagine the future of work.”

I mean, maybe? Maybe chatbots will reimagine the future of work. Maybe AI is eating the world; maybe it will consume the enterprise in particular. Maybe Google does need to replace Pichai with an AI researcher. Maybe Ramaswamy will turn Snowflake not into Oracle, but into [Apple](https://benn.substack.com/p/i-snowflake) or [Google](https://benn.substack.com/p/gsnowflake). Maybe people will [brag on their podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK4Mku_s4H4) about being among the first $6 billion in [xAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAI_(company)). I don’t know.

But for as much as tech Twitter and the financial markets have become enamored by AI, it doesn’t have that many success stories yet? Though some companies have made very real money from it—Nvidia is [printing cash](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/21/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q4-2024.html); OpenAI’s [business is booming](https://www.ft.com/content/81ac0e78-5b9b-43c2-b135-d11c47480119); Microsoft is the [most valuable company in the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/technology/microsoft-apple-most-valuable-company.html), at least until Nvidia passes it next month—these are the shovel salesmen, and shovel salesmen can still get rich on hype. Where is the gold? Where are the companies that have gotten rich *using* AI rather than *selling* AI?

There are *some* examples. Microsoft Copilot’s [makes more than $100 million](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/microsoft-github-copilot-revenue-100-million-ARR-ai) in annual recurring revenue. Midjourney might make [twice that](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/midjourney-revenue-valuation/). Last week, [Klarna claimed](https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-ai-assistant-handles-two-thirds-of-customer-service-chats-in-its-first-month/) that its support chatbot can do the work of 700 agents. And [in a recent blog post](https://openai.com/blog/openai-elon-musk), OpenAI talked about how free versions of GPT-4 were helping people:

> We provide broad access to today's most powerful AI, including a free version that hundreds of millions of people use every day. For example, Albania is using OpenAI’s tools to accelerate its EU accession by as much as 5.5 years; Digital Green is helping boost farmer income in Kenya and India by dropping the cost of agricultural extension services 100x by building on OpenAI; Lifespan, the largest healthcare provider in Rhode Island, uses GPT-4 to simplify its surgical consent forms from a college reading level to a 6th grade one; Iceland is using GPT-4 to preserve the Icelandic language.

Yes, these are all impressive and useful things. Yes, it’s early, and everyone’s still figuring all of this out. Yes, there are probably lots of other examples that I haven’t heard about, or stories that haven’t been publicly told. Yes, it’s probably smart to talk about preserving languages and making surgical consent forms more accessible when you want to win a PR battle against the richest man in the world and his lawsuit that accuses you of working for yourselves and not the betterment of humanity. Yes, AI may well live up to its trillions of dollars of promise. 

But it’s still just a promise.[^7] And it seems notable that, despite AI also producing [its fair share of flops](https://twitter.com/ProfNoahGian/status/1765403104432812442), nobody is betting against it. There are, to my knowledge, no Blockbusters saying that the [AI hysteria is completely overblown](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/netflix-blockbuster-meeting-marc-randolph-reed-hastings-john-antioco.html#:~:text=The%20dot%2Dcom%20hysteria%20is%20completely%20overblown.). There aren’t any clips of people saying that it’s [a newfangled radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgODUgHeT5Y), wondering why it [costs so much and doesn’t come with a keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qycUOENFIBs), or doubting it’s [so safe and easy after all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUlE02RU1AE). Every CEO, it seems, is instead [bending over backwards](https://fortune.com/2023/03/01/a-i-earnings-calls-mentions-skyrocket-companies-say-search-cybersecurity-medicine-customer-service/) to talk about how much they’re spending in AI. 

In other words, all the action [is on one side of the line](https://www.lasvegasadvisor.com/question/balancing-sports-book-action/). That doesn’t mean the bet is wrong, of course; the internet *is *bigger than the radio, and the $500 iPhone *is* more successful than the $99 [Motorola Q phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Q) and its 35 physical keys. But it probably means the bet is overvalued—or, maybe more importantly, the other side of the bet is *undervalued*. 

When the dust on this gold rush settles, it’s hard to imagine that there won’t be some companies that pivoted too far, and left too much of themselves behind in their scramble to reinvent themselves for the “[era of artificial intelligence](https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/).” And, with everyone throwing money and attention at people who zig towards AI, it’s hard to imagine there won’t be some companies—and VCs—who find undervalued talents and great investments in the people and ideas that are [great at zagging](https://www.amazon.co.uk/When-They-Zig-You-Zag/dp/0330360809).

# Whatever, do the secondary sales 

We [watched all those FanDuel](https://money.cnn.com/2015/10/08/media/fanduel-draftkings-commercials/index.html) ads [for nothing](https://www.fundablestartups.com/blog/half-a-billion):

> In July 2018, Paddy Power Betfair (now known as Flutter) acquired FanDuel for $465M in cash. On the surface, this looks like a great win for the FanDuel founders and employees. However, because the two lead investors held strong liquidation preference rights, the FanDuel founders and most employees received nothing in this massive deal.

You could interpret this story in a few ways. One version is about greed and power: It’s about selfish venture capitalists cheating founders of their rightfully deserved fortunes. From the same post:

> When the FanDuel founders raised funds, two key investors received a liquidation preference that entitled them to the first $559M in an acquisition. Founders and employees would be paid only if the acquisition exceeded $559M. Because the Paddy Power Betfair was for just $465M, the founders received nothing.

Liquidation preferences guarantee investors their return before anyone else gets paid. For example, suppose a VC buys 10 percent of a startup for $10 million, valuing the company at $100 million. Now, suppose the startup eventually sells for $20 million:

The FanDuel story could be about that: A warning to startup founders to watch out for VCs who load up their investments with punitive terms, and then rob founders blind. 

But another version of this story is simply about supply and demand. As [one VC described it](https://twitter.com/lpolovets/status/1765059002738593797), liquidation preferences are an elegant solution for clearing a mismatched market:

> For example, let's say a founder raised a round at $500m, then the company didn't do as well as hoped, and now realistically the company is worth $250m. The founder wants to raise more to try to regain momentum.
> A VC comes and says "ok, company is worth $250m, how about I put in $50m at a $250m valuation?"
> Founder says "you know, I really don't want a down round. I think it would hurt morale, upset previous investors, be bad press, etc. What would it take for you to invest at a $500m+ valuation like last time?"
> VC thinks and says "ok, how about $500m valuation, 3x liquidation preference?"
> The founder can now pick between a $250m and a 1x pref, or $500m and a 3x pref. Many will pick #1, but many others will pick #2.
> It's a rational VC offer -- if the company is worth $250m but wants to raise at $500m, then a liquidation preference can bridge that gap. The solution is kind of elegant, IMHO. But it can also lead to situations like the one described in the article above where a company has a good exit that gets swallowed up by the liquidation preference.

FanDuel raised [$416 million](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/fanduel/__BBppe0cAsiGDeKZsqttPvzi3qv6wK9yVGDEyb7LS35s/funding-and-investors), including a round that valued the company at [over a billion dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/14/fanicorn/). It makes sense that founders wouldn’t make anything for selling a business for barely more than the amount of money they spent to build it. It also makes sense that, in 2015, when FanDuel was in a [massive marketing war](https://money.cnn.com/2015/10/08/media/fanduel-draftkings-commercials/index.html) with DraftKings to become the dominant mobile betting app, FanDuel might’ve cared more about the positive optics of a huge funding round than they did about the negative terms that were attached to that round. It was an [arms race](https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2015/07/27/draftkings-brings-in-300-million-led-by-fox-sports/?sh=608a5c646e11), and FanDuel needed to keep up.

Still, there’s a third version of this story, about incentives. For FanDuel’s founders and employees, the problem wasn’t the liquidation preference per se; the problem was their incentives were no longer aligned with those of their investors. For some investors, a $465 million sale would net a decent return—and it would be especially appealing if the company was at some risk of unraveling further. For founders and employees, a $465 million sale is barely any better than going bankrupt. So investors voted to sell—[“it’s just business, you understand”](https://benn.substack.com/p/whatever-do-the-secondary-sale#:~:text=well%2C%20that%E2%80%99s%20business.)—and founders couldn’t stop them.

That’s the real issue with liquidation preferences. If a company raises money on clean terms, its investors and founders are generally aligned. But for companies that have messy terms, there are often ranges of outcomes where the incentives get very distorted. For example, FanDuel’s founders had no incentive to try to push the $465 million sale into a $500 million sale; they get paid nothing either way. But FanDuel’s investors had every incentive to do it, because for every extra dollar that got added to sale price, they’d get 100 cents of it. And similarly, FanDuel’s investors would be more or less indifferent to a $560 million sale compared to a $600 million sale, because most of *those* returns would go to founders and employees. Founders and employees, by contrast, would have the opposite incentive—that $40 million would be the only $40 million they get.

That’s because once the sale price clears the liquidation preferences, everyone—founders and investors alike—get paid out relative to their ownership share. Given that FanDuel’s series E investors put in $275 million at a valuation of over $1 billion, let’s assume they owned 25 percent of the company, and would therefore get paid 25 percent of any returns over $559 million. That implies roughly the following returns for those investors:

All of their returns come from increasing the sale price up to $559 million, and not much comes from increasing it above $559 million. For founders, it’s the opposite: They would make $0 in the first four cases, about $6 million in the $600 million sale (assuming they own 20 percent of the company), and about $26 million in the $700 million. 

These incentives dramatically change how people would run a company. Once they took the term sheets with the 3x liquidation preferences, FanDuel’s founders needed to swing for the fences; sell for at least $600 million or bust. For investors, the opposite was true—so long as the company didn’t sink too much, they were probably ok. 

For all of [the histrionics about secondary sales](https://benn.substack.com/p/whatever-do-the-secondary-sale) distorting incentives, liquidation preferences are far worse. Even if a founder does a large secondary sale, everyone is still aligned: Exiting the company for more is better, and every extra dollar is as roughly beneficial as the last. With liquidation preferences, that’s no longer true. The investors become overwhelmingly incentivized to sell for *up to* a certain price and then it doesn’t matter that much; founders become overwhelmingly incentivized to sell for *at least *that price, and everything above it is all that matters.

# The posters decide

*Who picks Silicon Valley’s winners?*

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JA_j!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6efeba3-1f28-4d04-bb80-86db709be976_1200x630.png)
*It’s a tough call to choose which ChatGPT wrapper to invest in. They’re so different.*

Personally, 2020 is not the year I would choose to go back and relive, but earlier this week, the United States decided that is what it wanted, and [nominated Joe Biden and Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/12/us/politics/trump-republican-nomination.html) to run for president again. 

They both won their respective elections because they were ostensibly the most preferred candidates by American voters. However, [there is a theory](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo5921600.html) among political scientists that voters have less say in who wins presidential primaries than it appears. Nominees are chosen by party insiders and Washington power brokers, who typically coalesce around a preferred candidate, and then court donors, secure key endorsements, and recruit talented staffers on that candidate’s behalf. These efforts tilt the playing field towards their candidate, by giving them material advantages like more money and a better team, and by creating media narratives—three Super Tuesday governors all endorsed [Bill Pullman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_QSJyJaeD4)! Key donors are having second thoughts about supporting [Billy Bob Thorton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA3WLXRuC9E&t=171s)!—that define one candidate as a frontrunner and others as fringe. 

Importantly, this isn’t some conspiracy theory about stealing elections, or smoke-filled secret societies, or the Illuminati; voters still vote, and their votes still count. It’s a theory of *influence*: Parties have influencers; those influencers have money, followers, and connections; those resources can be used to alter public opinion. Sometimes, influencers will disagree; sometimes, their [influence isn’t enough to sway voters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Republicans_who_opposed_the_Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign); sometimes, voters sway influencers’ opinions. Still, the argument goes, we shouldn’t see elections as decided by an entirely free market—and the more the insiders agree, the less say the everyday voter has.[^1] 

But this is all a Washington thing; this blog is about Silicon Valley; Silicon Valley is not like Washington. A few months ago, Bill Gurley, a prominent venture capitalist and the personification of Silicon Valley swagger, [said in a thundering presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9cO3-MLHOM&t=1424s) that “Silicon Valley is 2,851 miles away from Washington, and as these people put their eyes towards us, I would state the following: The reason Silicon Valley has been so successful is that it’s so fucking far away from Washington, DC.” The line got a standing ovation. Here, we don’t have cabals; we have free-market capitalism. There is no “party” that “decides;” there are no monied superdelegates; there is no [invisible primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_primary). There is only the invisible hand—users who choose, customers who buy, [ideas whose time has come](https://twitter.com/Eric_BIGfund/status/1766807871843393854).[^2] This is a meritocracy, [if Washington will let us keep it](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/constitutionalconvention-september17.htm).

Or at least that’s a nice story? Because Silicon Valley sure seems to be driven by the exact same dynamic that people say drives presidential primaries: Elite insiders choosing who gets money and who doesn’t, influencing who can hire and who can’t, and tilting markets and (social) media narratives in favor of their preferred technologies, companies, and founders. In other words, in the way we chose our successes, Silicon Valley doesn’t seem very far from Washington at all.

# Same medium, subtle differences

When people ask me about the very early days of working at Mode, I often say that [I wrote articles for our corporate blog](https://mixpanel.com/blog/benn-stancil-mode-thoughtspot-newsletter/#:~:text=So%20the%20thing%20that%20I%20started%20doing%20was%20writing%20blog%20posts%20for%20Mode%E2%80%99s%20corporate%20blog.). This isn't entirely true. The initial posts that I wrote weren’t actually published on Mode’s website, but on a blogging platform called [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com/). I wrote my first blog post as a Mode employee two days after we started the company,[^3] which was well before we had a corporate brand—and therefore, well before we had a website on which we could host a blog. So we had to choose a third-party platform instead.

Back then, the two up-and-coming options were Svbtle and Medium.[^4] As products, they were [basically identical](https://medium.com/@erickuhn19/medium-vs-svbtle-25dbaa145402)—both were very easy to set up; both embraced the crisp millennial minimalism aesthetic that was irresistible in 2013;[^5] both came with nifty charts that would show me the dozens (dozens!) of people who read what I wrote; both had nascent distribution and discovery features that would, in theory, push my posts out to new readers via some algorithmic recommendation engine. I chose Svbtle, and passed on Medium, for none of these reasons. I chose it because [it was still invite-only](https://blog.svbtle.com/open-for-everyone) and using it made the egomaniac in me feel special, and because Svtle’s “like” feature—called Kudos[^6]—was fun.[^7] 

Most of Silicon Valley’s elite chose Medium. It raised money from some of the industry's most followed venture capitalists, including Greylock’s [Josh Elman](https://joshelman.medium.com/), a16z’s [Ben Horowitz](https://medium.com/@bhorowitz), and Google Ventures’ [M.G. Siegler](https://mgs.blog/), all of whom began posting on Medium. Though Svbtle had [fans](https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/low-overhead-blogging-platform-svbtle-opens-up-to-all/) and [notable backers](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/svbtle) of its own, most prominent writers in tech—[Hunter Walk](https://hunterwalk.medium.com/), [Julie Zhuo](https://joulee.medium.com/), [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://medium.com/@dhh), [Jason Fried](https://medium.com/@jasonfried), [Jason Calcanis](https://medium.com/@jason), [Stewart Butterfield](https://medium.com/@stewart), [Anil Dash](https://medium.com/@anildash), [Chris Sacca](https://medium.com/@sacca), [Dustin Moskovitz](https://medium.com/@moskov), [Brad Feld](https://medium.com/@bfeld), even [Bill Gurley](https://medium.com/@bgurley)—coalesced around Medium. Within two years, [people were declaring](https://robertnealan.com/is-self-hosted-blogging-dead/) Svbtle dead, and had accepted Medium as Silicon Valley’s default blogging platform. 

Of course, products succeed and fail for lots of reasons. We’ll never know exactly why Medium won and Svbtle lost. Maybe Medium’s editor was a little better; maybe its viral distribution loops were a little tighter. Maybe Medium was right [to hire their own writers](https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/medium-acquires-matter-as-long-form-journalism-site-joins-evan-williams-startup/). Maybe bombastic VC grandstanding is better paired with an elegant [serif](https://ev.medium.com/welcome-to-medium-9e53ca408c48) than austere [sans serif](https://blog.svbtle.com/open-for-everyone). Maybe Svbtle was [too exclusive](https://www.garron.me/en/blog/svbtle-vs-medium.html) for too long. Maybe [product science](https://medium.com/@sall/product-scientist-ffd1ae846172) really works. I don’t know. 

But as someone who was publishing on Svbtle at the time, it felt like the only thing that mattered was Medium's momentum—and specifically, its momentum among people who had big existing followings. When I shared my posts, people periodically asked me why I was using Svbtle. Wasn’t Medium the thing everyone was using now? Could I [not get an invite to it yet](https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/25/twitter-co-founder-evan-williams-blogging-platform-medium-opens-signups-to-all/)? If you used Medium, you were a respectable writer with an independent voice. If you knew about it, you were in the club. IYKYK.

Very little of this perception came from people’s lived experiences of writing on Medium, and even less of it came from people who had tried both products and found the nuances of Medium to be more effective or more agreeable than Svbtle. Medium’s momentum came from important people in Silicon Valley posting on it and posting about it on Twitter, and from the rest of us following them. That doesn’t discount the quality of Medium’s product—it was good, and Silicon Valley’s influencers surely talked about it in part because it was good. But [it feels incomplete to tell the story](https://mariusmasalar.me/farewell-to-svbtle-fb9ca1da38db) of Medium’s success, and of Svbtle’s failure, by just talking about the product. Surely, the party also played a role. 

# The emperor occasionally experiments with editing

If I’m really honest about it, watching this unfold probably had an overly formative effect on me and my sense of how Silicon Valley works. But still, once you see it—once you see elite opinion become public perception, and public perception become at least some sort of reality—it’s hard not to see it everywhere. There was a moment in 2014 [when Slack was suddenly the only product](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/slack-app-store-jump-a16z/) anyone could talk about. There was a moment in 2016 when Airtable, a fairly confusing product that wasn’t easily identifiable as anything, was broadly hailed as the new way to build everything. There was a moment in 2017 when VCs and startup founders were obsessed with—and obsessed with talking about—Superhuman. 

There was another moment like this earlier this week. A small startup called Cognition Labs [launched Devin](https://twitter.com/cognition_labs/status/1767548763134964000), an AI agent that can develop software applications on its own. The video blew up, with [dozens](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1767603551927242809) [of](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1767718092250235073) [notable](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1767598414945292695) [Silicon](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1767580614234906820) [Valley](https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1767662981540950163) [influencers](https://twitter.com/AravSrinivas/status/1767582756291387484) posting about how Devin was a remarkable leap forward for both AI and for software development. Within a few hours of the announcement, [people were already suggesting](https://twitter.com/thogge/status/1767592255433617649) that it might be the next *$100* billion company, which is 25 percent more than [even OpenAI is currently worth](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/technology/openai-artificial-intelligence-deal-valuation.html).

Which, maybe! A hundred billion seems high, but I don’t know! Cognition CEO Scott Wu [can apparently solve impossible math questions](https://twitter.com/jfbrly/status/1767653596957642879) in less time than it takes most of us to *read *impossible math questions, so if you have to put a bet down on something, I guess Cognition is as good as anything. 

What seems notable, though, is I’m not saying that because I’ve used Devin, which is still behind a closed beta, nor am I saying it that because the launch video was *that* unique or impressive. There are tons of companies building AI agents like Devin, and [you can never fully trust a pre-recorded demo](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/07/googles-best-gemini-demo-was-faked/). Instead, my belief in the potential of Cognition comes entirely from other people’s belief in the potential of Cognition—which was, *at least to some degree*, [astroturfed](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1767603551927242809) [by](https://twitter.com/saranormous/status/1767564859603030352) [Cognition’s](https://twitter.com/eglyman/status/1767556597348470813) [investors](https://twitter.com/absoluttig/status/1767556549445341263) and [PR team](https://twitter.com/lulumeservey/status/1767657576106275041).

The point here isn’t that the emperor has no clothes, or even that they don’t have $100 billion clothes. The point is that [nobody has seen the emperor](https://variety.com/2024/politics/global/where-is-kate-middleton-altered-photo-controversy-1235940634/). Investors have, and we’ve [seen curated demos](https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/1767135566645092616?s=20), and the emperor is very good at math. But the clothes are still invite-only. And yet, all at once, the entire internet began telling the same stories of their wonder.

Imagine that you didn’t see the Devin demo because a Silicon Valley celebrity tweeted about it. Imagine that the video only had a few thousand views. Imagine that you found it on the second page of Product Hunt, on a slow Thursday afternoon. Imagine it had fifteen upvotes and a lonely comment from the “maker,” saying they were very excited to share their project with the world. Imagine that the thing itself was exactly the same, but there was no party and no posting around it. 

Would it be impressive? Would you think anything of it? Would you want to invest? Would you roll your eyes at what was probably the fourth AI bot that you saw on your bored scroll through Product Hunt? 

I really don’t know. I doubt I would’ve thought that it was any different [than the other belts I’ve seen](https://youtu.be/Ja2fgquYTCg?si=YuDLxIpLKtbAB2za&t=26). Which may well be *wrong*—Devin really might be different, and in ten years, Devin may be building all of our websites, and our phone apps, and even future Devins. But without the hype, I don’t think Devin and its five minute sizzle reel would register to me as anything that was particularly noteworthy. 

But *with* the hype, I would invest in it? Partly, perhaps, because [I’ve seen the light](https://twitter.com/lulumeservey/status/1767730891957116938), but more because Silicon Valley’s influencers—the party—have decided that Devin is important. Cognition can now easily court investors, secure key partnerships, and recruit talented staffers. The playing field is tilted in their favor; they have material advantages like more money and a better team, and a media narrative that defines them as a frontrunner in a very noisy space.[^8] And once you’re on the ballot, you’ve got a shot.

# From a pile of “stuff”

On one hand, all this is very silly to say. Of course this is how Silicon Valley works. It's how everything works. Party elites don’t influence presidential primaries because of some unique culture of cronyism in Washington DC; they influence primaries because social systems have hierarchies, hierarchies have people at the top, and the people beneath them pay a lot of attention to what the people above them do. If Taylor Swift likes Travis Kelce, [we all like Travis Kelce](https://www.nfl.com/news/chiefs-te-travis-kelce-jersey-sales-jump-nearly-400-following-taylor-swift-appea). If Oscar de la Renta does cerulean, [we all do cerulean](https://artdepartmental.com/blog/devil-wears-prada-cerulean-monologue). If the president says it’s a revolution, [we storm the Capitol](https://twitter.com/hunterw/status/1346919171595137025?lang=en). If engineers who work for OpenAI say that Devin will transform software development, we tweet memes about how Devin is five years from taking our jobs. If important people post about something a lot, we start to post about it too—that is not a novel point to make.

On the other hand, it still seems useful to say? The conversations about these dynamics in Silicon Valley tend to exist on the poles. There are conspiracy theorists on one side, who say that [Silicon Valley is controlled by mob bosses and hitmen](https://www.businessinsider.com/bolt-ceo-calls-stripe-ycombinator-mob-bosses-twitter-silicon-valley-2022-1), and there are [heads-down hustle heroes](https://twitter.com/mwseibel/status/1592885186416738306) on the other, who say that the only thing that matters is what you build. 

The reality is somewhere in the middle. Investors and tech twitter personalities aren’t all in one group chat, masterfully pulling our strings in unison, but they aren’t external observers either. In that, Silicon Valley isn’t exempt from the same dynamic that drives every industry: There are influencers, and there are the influenced. Though companies ultimately live and die on their own merits—in recent years, [Medium’s road has been rocky](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/12/medium-profitability-2024-interview/)—the party decides which companies win the early-stage primaries.[^9] And our predictions about breakthrough technologies and breakout successes aren’t the product of lived experiences and independent analysis. They are [selected for us](https://artdepartmental.com/blog/devil-wears-prada-cerulean-monologue/#:~:text=However%2C%20that%20blue%20represents%20millions%20of%20dollars%20of%20countless%20jobs%2C%20and%20it%E2%80%99s%20sort%20of%20comical%20how%20you%20think%20that%20you%E2%80%99ve%20made%20a%20choice%20that%20exempts%20you%20from%20the%20fashion%20industry%20when%2C%20in%20fact%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20wearing%20a%20sweater%20that%20was%20selected%20for%20you%20by%20the%20people%20in%20this%20room%E2%80%A6%20from%20a%20pile%20of%20%E2%80%9Cstuff.%E2%80%9D).

[^1]: Prior to 2016, some people believed that, if voters and insiders were at odds, the insiders’ candidate would win, which led to some [ill](https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/622506176803119104)-[fated](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trumps-six-stages-of-doom/) [predictions](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/22/donald-trump-wont-win-republican-presidential-nomination) about Trump’s chances in the primary (a primary which he has now [won three times](https://hnn.us/blog/154756)). A seemingly [more accurate version of the theory](https://www.vox.com/2015/9/23/9352273/party-decides-trump-sanders) makes adjustments for how much the insiders agree. If they all coalesce around one candidate—say, Hillary Clinton—they can have a lot of influence. But if they don’t agree, they tend to be less effective. Succeed together or fail alone, I guess.

But *after* Devin comes out, the second story is the one we tell ourselves.

[^9]: Is that *bad*? No? It’s probably fine? You could argue that this is the point of venture capital, to have experts comb through haystacks of startups looking for the needles with potential. The social media blitz around Cognition may well be a good thing, if Cognition is the company that we need to make better software, and if the hype around Cognition is what it needs to realize its full potential.

*[Eventually, the feds find you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SvJ--JVU9w)*

If you find yourself many years into running a Ponzi scheme, you have three choices:

You could try to keep the Ponzi scheme going! Keep raising more money from investors, and hope to die before you get caught. This isn't a great option—for a Ponzi scheme to sustain itself, it has to keep getting bigger, and raising more and more money is hard. Plus, the bigger it gets, the more likely it is that people might start asking questions and find out that it's a Ponzi scheme. And if it gets so big that the Securities and Exchange Commission finds out that it's a Ponzi scheme, they will arrest you and [you will go to jail for 150 years](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/newyork/press-releases/2009/nyfo062909.htm). Not good. 

Second, you could stop doing the Ponzi scheme. This will probably upset your clients, because you will have to tell them that you don’t have any of their money, because you were running a Ponzi scheme. It will also probably upset the SEC, who will still arrest you and throw you in jail. But the judge might give you a lighter sentence if you stop doing the Ponzi scheme on your own, when it’s still a healthy Ponzi scheme and not a collapsing Ponzi scheme. I don't know. Seems risky. It might be better to hope that you don’t get caught. 

Finally, you could try to turn the Ponzi scheme into a real business? If your Ponzi scheme hasn’t imploded yet, you still have money in the bank. Do something real with it! Launch a startup. Trade crypto. Buy stocks that actually [return a steady 11 percent a year](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-dec-13-fi-madoff13-story.html#:~:text=Madoff%20claimed%20an%20average%20annual%20return%20of%20better%20than%2011%25%20but%20with%20very%20little%20volatility%2C%20according%20to%20a%20person%20familiar%20with%20the%20matter). Open a coffee shop and [sell it to a yogurt company for $900 million](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/18/chobani-buys-la-colombe-coffee). This is hard to do, and it’s almost certainly better to do it without doing the Ponzi scheme first, but if you already stole the money, you might as well try to make the most of it. Best of all, if you pull it off, nobody will ever know that your business started as a Ponzi scheme.[^1] 

Though the SEC won’t like this plan—you still ran a Ponzi scheme, and they will still want to arrest you for that—*your investors *might be ok with it. A thing about Ponzi schemes is that they’re great investments[^2] so long as you get out before they blow up. Financially speaking—not ethically or morally, and definitely not legally—your early investors are doing great! They have been making a steady, above-market, risk-free return! They probably want to keep that. If you get arrested for running a Ponzi scheme, not only will you go to jail for 150 years, they will have to [give back all of their returns](https://webreprints.djreprints.com/4743180552220.html). Bad for everyone.

So it seems like there's a trade here. You offer your existing investors a deal: If they don't tell the SEC that you've been running a Ponzi scheme, you’ll pivot your Ponzi scheme into a legitimate business. If it doesn’t work—[if your coffee shop doesn’t make it](https://www.reuters.com/business/coffee-trader-mercon-files-bankruptcy-protection-2023-12-07/)—everyone loses, just as they would’ve anyway: Your investors lose their money, and you go to jail.[^3] *But if it works*, everyone wins: Your investors keep their previous returns, they get new returns from your successful company, and you don’t go to jail. It’s a graceful escape, if you pivot to the right thing. 

# Data is a four-letter word

Well, not quite. *Data *is not a Ponzi scheme. Financial reporting and business intelligence are the only senses that many businesses have, and even the [biggest cynics](https://benn.substack.com/archive?sort=search&search=fails) can’t contort themselves into saying that this stuff isn’t important. And operational telemetry, and the automated algorithms built on top of it, generates trillions in revenues in Amazon’s warehouses, on Google’s ad networks, and across factory floors and insurance companies and trading desks around the world. These are all real and enormously valuable applications of data.

But within the field of *analytics*—the practice of trying to make better strategic decisions with data and manual analysis—the track record is less compelling. Here, the animating narrative has long been the same: Data is full of [useful insights](https://hbr.org/2016/09/building-an-insights-engine). Companies that don’t find them are doomed to [fall behind and die](https://hbr.org/2021/06/legacy-companies-need-to-become-more-data-driven-fast). Analysts are the experts who can [extract those insights](https://hbr.org/2018/12/what-great-data-analysts-do-and-why-every-organization-needs-them). Sure, we can’t live up to our full potential *today*—our data is [too messy](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html); our data is [too unreliable](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-the-rise-of-data-downtime/); engineers are [too busy](https://dataproducts.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-data-contracts) to help keep it clean; our tools [are broken;](https://www.sisense.com/blog/business-intelligence-is-broken/) our workflows [are broken](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-analysts-workflow-is-broken-dccbe72398b7); we are [buried behind less important work](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/12/data-breadlines-and-data-brawls/); we [distract ourselves](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/making-friends-with-the-truth); we don’t know how [to organize ourselves](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3980295); executives [don’t support us](https://hbr.org/2022/02/why-becoming-a-data-driven-organization-is-so-hard); they treat us like [second-class citizens](https://petrjanda.substack.com/p/elevate-the-role-of-analytics-in); people don’t know [how to work with us](https://davidsj.substack.com/p/dear-stakeholder); people [don’t invite us](https://wrongbutuseful.substack.com/p/elbows-of-data) into the important rooms; people are [illiterate](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252528296/Data-leaders-bewail-employee-data-illiteracy?_gl=1*1gd4fed*_ga*NTIxNTE2MjQ3LjE3MTA5Mzc5MDA.*_ga_TQKE4GS5P9*MTcxMDkzNzg5OS4xLjEuMTcxMDkzNzkwOC4wLjAuMA..).[^4] But on the other side of these problems, just over the horizon, there is [an oasis](https://madmax.fandom.com/wiki/The_Green_Place) of scholarship and shareholder value. 

Keep plugging, and we’ll finally clean up this mess.[^5] Keep plugging, and our potential energy will become realized energy. Keep plugging, and we’ll fulfill the long-told prophecy that data will become every company’s [single most important asset](https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/teradata/why-data-is-the-single-most-important-asset-for-companies-of-the-future/). As data teams, this is our gospel: One day, when the glory comes, it will be ours; one day, [when this war is won](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2id9x9).[^6] 

As a philosophical point, I suppose this might be true. Though I have my doubts, it’s impossible to know what *could* be, given more time to build better tools, cultivate better cultures, educate more coworkers, and enlighten more executives. As a practical point, however, I’m not sure how much these hypotheticals matter. The question is not whether such a world exists, but if we will ever get there?

More pointedly, it's this: Would you, as a reader of this blog and presumably someone who is at least vaguely optimistic about this whole analytics endeavor, bet your entire bank account[^7] that we will—collectively, in general, on average—reach that promised land, in which data is democratized and insights are liberated and businesses are empowered and various other nouns are [actioned](https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/spread-of-corporate-speak.html)? Or would you take the other side, and bet that most analytics teams slog along, heaving slowly forwards through the same briar patches that we’ve been stuck in for years? A decade from now, will most analytics teams—not *your *team, of course I have faith in *you*—be seamlessly driving critical corporate decisions? Will they be plucking new business opportunities out of haystacks of data? Will they be invited to weigh in every key debate, and have a seat around every key table? Will they be a competitive advantage? 

Or will they continue to toil on the fringes, responding to queues of feckless questions, adding bits of value here and improving some marginal thing there, while continuing to say, to others and to themselves, that better days are ahead?

If my life savings were on the line, my answer is that our [hope is a mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBHPhD7YKj4), and most analysts will never escape their current lot. As we’ve talked about many times before, analytics might be an inherently flawed enterprise. Data is [fundamentally messy](https://benn.substack.com/p/will-we-ever-have-clean-data) and [fundamentally biased](https://benn.substack.com/p/tilt-and-tilted). Turning this data into useful information requires [rare analytical skills](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-technical-pay-gap); turning information into better business results requires [courage](https://benn.substack.com/p/does-data-make-us-cowards) and [a knack for persuasion](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-case-for-being-biased). Unless we can teach these skills at scale, which [we probably cannot](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-product-is-the-process), there will be [little demand](https://benn.substack.com/p/data-teams-product-market-fit) for the everyday analytics team’s work, and [little advantage](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-data-driven-companies-win) for the everyday company to invest in analytics. 

In short, my answer is that analytics—not as an industry or as a technology ecosystem, but *as a discipline*—might not work. The average company may never be able to make better decisions by hiring a team of average analysts. We can [make dashboards](https://benn.substack.com/p/data-is-for-dashboards) and be [operational accountants](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-end-of-our-purple-era). But the fun, exploratory, “valuable” work may always be an indulgent, empty dessert, and never the entrée we want it to be. 

Which is an awkward answer, because in some rough way, my life savings *is* on the line. For many of us who work in data, we were hired to build this data-driven, insight-rich, collectively shared future. If we don’t, the whole apparatus—our jobs, our conferences, our startups, our academies, our statuses, all of it—will fall apart. 

Though no, that’s not exactly right. People in the analytics profession haven’t bet their life savings on *building* that future; we’ve bet our life savings on other people *believing in* that future. As long as people have faith in its potential, the machine can stay upright. Our executive overlords, many of whom probably feel that they aren't getting their money’s worth out of what we *are*, can mentally reclassify our salaries as down payments for what we *will be*. Vendors can [keep promising ](https://benn.substack.com/p/insight-industrial-complex#:~:text=MicroStrategy%2C%20a%20BI,on%20our%20homepages.)*[future](https://benn.substack.com/p/insight-industrial-complex#:~:text=MicroStrategy%2C%20a%20BI,on%20our%20homepages.)*[ insights](https://benn.substack.com/p/insight-industrial-complex#:~:text=MicroStrategy%2C%20a%20BI,on%20our%20homepages.). We can keep trotting out explanations—data quality, data literacy, executive support, the distractions from AI, whatever—for why we aren’t yet a *[true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman)*[ analytics team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman). Our Ponzi scheme can stay solvent, until [I’ll be gone and you’ll be gone](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/IBGYBG), and another generation can worry about what comes next.

# The walls close in

Honestly, it might work. People [unquestionably accept](https://benn.substack.com/i/140842906/clique) that data is valuable; it wouldn't take much to keep that faith alive. 

But what if we assume we can't perpetuate it anymore? Suppose money gets tight, and the SEC (Stingy, Efficient CEO) runs out of patience. They demand to know how we plan on making our work worth what we’re paid. They’re onto our scheme, and our usual explanation—that it’ll all get better, once we complete a few eternal prerequisites—will no longer fly. This sounds like a Ponzi scheme, the SECEO will say, and in [years of efficiency](https://fortune.com/2024/02/02/meta-stock-earnings-zuckerberg-year-of-efficiency-layoffs-dividend/), Ponzi schemes get fired. 

One obvious answer is to stop doing the Ponzi scheme. Dissolve the analytics team. Trade in our big promises for something smaller. Instead of getting fired, take a reduced sentence: Twenty years to life of building reports and maintaining operational infrastructure. Become more like IT or HR—invaluable components in the corporate machinery, but with fewer delusions of grandeur. Accept our lot in life as bean counters, concede that our “insights” [aren’t business-critical](https://davidsj.substack.com/p/the-value-of-data), no matter how much we [beg people to use them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqPr6bcTJhc), and count the beans.

I mean, maybe, but man, that is unsatisfying. People make decisions all the time, those decisions are rooted in facts, and facts are rooted in data. This basic logic seems so sound. Surely there’s a way to make this work? Surely there’s something more legitimate, and more reliably useful, that we could gracefully pivot into?

# The adversarial analytics team

Go to any data conference, and there will almost certainly be a few talks about how data teams can be better partners with their business counterparts. It would be funny if someone gave a talk on how we could be more adversarial instead. Rather than showing people a dashboard of KPIs, use some black box algorithm to [blend them all into a single composite](https://www.counting-stuff.com/how-does-the-air-quality-index-work-65949948516031001b35123a/). Rather than giving someone a day-by-day time series or a scatter plot with individual data points, make every chart a trend line. Rather than telling anyone the exact value of a metric, always round it to the nearest Fibonacci number: “Two months, we had 610 orders. Last month, about 610 again. This month, we’re up to about 987. We can’t share any more detail than that.”

This is obviously kind of dumb, probably kind of fraud,[^8] and…might kind of work? Because whenever we share metrics with people, this is mostly what they do anyway: Squint, decide if the line is going up a lot, up a little, flat, down a little, or down a lot. Though small statistical details matter for operational optimization problems, the *analytical *decisions that executives make are mostly based on these sorts of directional vibes. The line is [wiggling](https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-first-principles/); is it noise or is something changing? Customer retention is declining; let’s hire more account managers. Everyone is talking about AI; let’s send dump trucks of cash to the houses of [famous AI experts](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/technology/mustafa-suleyman-google-gemini.html). We struggle to sell to women; let’s make a [horror movie](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1765376794746642730) about it.

This is part of why customer interviews [are often more valuable](https://benn.substack.com/p/avg-text) than analyzing a bunch of data, even though the latter is the stuff of scientific inquiry, and the former is gossip. In so many cases, gossip is what people want.[^9] CEOs want to know what their customers are thinking. Behavioral data isn’t “truth;” it’s an observable proxy, the input to a kind of analytical alchemy that attempts to turn individual outcomes into generalizations about intentions. In some sense, the careful rigor of data analysis is a red herring—it’s what we were trained to sell, but not the main thing our customers want to buy. 

Perhaps that’s actually what’s held us back for so long: numbers, more or less. Though most business decisions are driven by numbers, those numbers matter because they define people’s loose mental models for how the world works, not because people need to know about the often-meaningless tedium of things like [statistical significance](https://counting.substack.com/p/accidentally-trapping-ourselves-with). By talking primarily in the language of exact facts and figures, we make ourselves dismissible, because nobody *really* cares about the precise amount some metric went up or down. At the end of the day, executives care if the world still works the way they think it does. Everything else is just [bluster](https://wrongbutuseful.substack.com/p/beware-the-sloth) and[ bikeshedding](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-arguing-about-metrics-is-a-waste-of-time-b1c6f9026724).

Disband or rebrand—that may be our choice. Analytics teams don’t have to be bound to data teams, and that association might be our problem. We might be better off finding other departments to operate in, and advertising ourselves as majors in that field with a minor in analytics, rather than the other way around. It might not be the fun thing we imagined, but it’s the useful thing we would get paid and [promoted](https://medium.com/@mikldd/why-the-100x-analyst-doesnt-exist-1a16019aff19) for. Because after flirting with a life of crime, we might need to start keeping our backstory a secret, and [learn to blend in with everyone else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MedC8kTa9XY&t=49s).

[^1]: I mean, they might be suspicious. If, say, [CryptoFX](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-35) stopped offering “‘risk free’ and ‘guaranteed’ crypto and foreign exchange investments,” and started selling cold brew, the SEC will probably have some questions. But still. When they show up, it would help if you had a real business and not just a Ponzi scheme.

[^2]: issuing correction on a previous statement of mine, regarding Ponzi schemes. you do not, [under any circumstances](https://twitter.com/dril/status/831805955402776576), "gotta hand it to them"

[^3]: Sure, it’s more complicated than this. If your Ponzi scheme gets raided by the SEC, your investors will lose their illegitimate returns, but they might recover some of their principal. If you spend their money on a startup, they might lose all of it on your business’ expenses, like employees’ salaries and coffee beans and [350,000 H100 Nvidia graphics cards](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/18/mark-zuckerberg-indicates-meta-is-spending-billions-on-nvidia-ai-chips.html). Plus, if they make a deal with you and you get caught, I assume they might also go to jail for “[allowing the fraud to continue unabated](https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/07/mets-owners-face-novel-claim-in-madoff-clawback/index.html).” But that doesn’t change the overall point: Your investors would prefer that your Ponzi scheme becomes a legitimate business, and would not prefer that Ponzi scheme blow ups.

[^4]: [“I can’t read Liz Lemon!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggjN4IExDeI&t=208s)

[^5]: All of our messy data sources will neatly write into a centralized warehouse. Each pipeline will be actively governed by a tightly written data contract. Data marts will be documented with encyclopedic completeness and precision. People will know where to go to ask questions. Answers will be delivered in-line and on-demand. People will be skilled in its language and its limits. Errors will promptly trigger alerts. And so on and so forth.

[^6]: Yes, fair, on one hand, this is a melodramatic and appropriative link. On the other hand, it’s a banger of a performance and everyone should watch it. I’m aware that our “struggles” as analytics teams are, relatively speaking, quite silly.

We don’t keep track of what happens to the 63,245,986 dollars in between. No, you cannot look at my personal bank statement.”

# All at one time

*What to do at a corporate conference.*

---

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hFp0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa73a9220-e25e-4efe-b688-79184a020e11_1280x720.png)
*[Look once more, just around the riverbend.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do5TwE_jYnE)*

I used to think that professional conferences were for learning, then I thought they were for networking, and then I thought they were for nothing at all.

I mean, they *should* be educational. Most conferences are centered around a program of dozens of talks by industry experts and luminaries, who condense the most important lessons of their lives into a twenty-minute sizzle reel. They’re Bohr with five key takeaways about the atom, Planck with a PowerPoint on quantum theory, and Einstein explaining general relativity with dank memes, all in the morning session before lunch.[^1] It’s a parade of giants, offering their shoulders for us to stand on. We should probably walk away a lot smarter than we started.

And yet, bizarrely, we usually don’t, not really. For as much experience as there is behind most conference talks, we typically leave them leave with a few forgettable notes and no lasting wisdom. Nearly every talk starts with hard-earned lessons learned; more often than not, we still make the same mistakes. Nearly every talk ends with actionable advice; we rarely [action](https://benn.substack.com/p/disband-the-analytics-team#:~:text=various%20other%20nouns%20are%20actioned) it.[^2] Instead, most talks are treated as a mutually beneficial charade: The presenters aren’t there to teach, but to be recognized and celebrated; the audience isn’t there to become enlightened, but to *feel* enlightened. The presenter gets their fawning audience, the audience gets their cosmetic education, and everyone goes home feeling good about themselves.[^3]

Seasoned conference veterans will say all of this is obvious. Conferences aren’t about learning; they’re about networking. They’re a three-day annual MBA: We don’t attend them for the classes, but for the break from the office grind, for the LinkedIn connections, and for the parties. 

But after a handful of conferences, it’s easy to sour on the parties too. The social events of every conference [follow the same rhythm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJNYxpEAh68): Happy hour in the vendor hall. A sponsored dinner; cocktails at six, with a seated meal at seven; space is limited so please RSVP early. The after-party goes from 8:30 pm until late. The bar will be packed; everyone will be wearing backpacks; the barback will be struggling to wind their way through a packed bar full of backpacks. 

The events themselves [also all rhyme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs4tNeGyTyI). A dinner will be hosted at some place called *barn&barley*, or *The Farmer’s Daughter*, or *Finch. *The person you wanted to see won’t be there this year. The person you wanted to avoid will be standing between you and the bar. Please take your seats; dinner will be served shortly. A welcome toast; a reminder that there is no agenda, no sales pitch; this is just about having good conversations with good friends. We’re so glad you could make it. Dinner will start with burrata and seasonal vegetables. Dinner will be family style. Dinner will be a barrage of offensively under-seasoned farm-to-table classics: a sage ravioli; seared salmon served over a bed of greens; bavette steak. Dinner will be plausibly healthy—Brussels sprouts, carrots with a balsamic demi-glace, a grilled pork tenderloin with a red wine jus. Dinner will keep coming, one relentless plate after the other, enough food to serve the 40 attendees plus 40 more. Unless you’re a vegetarian; for vegetarians, dinner will be cheese noodles; spring greens and olive oil; a glass of ice water; a raw potato. 

Everyone will be full. The steak is half eaten; at least one whole chicken will be completely untouched. Tea? Espresso? Another glass of the white? Dessert this evening will be a blueberry cheesecake and our house compote; it will be a pistachio ice cream, with a pistachio crumble; it will be a little jar of chocolate goo, topped with vanilla goo. Nobody will be hungry, but the twenty desserts will come anyway, followed by forty small spoons. 

Thirty-nine people have trickled out. Alan is still here. Alan wants a little more red. Alan is from the UK; Alan has two kids; Alan is finally away from his two kids; Alan won’t leave. It is just the hosts, Alan, and several plates of pistachio ice cream, melting into the tablecloth. Alan is kind of drunk; Alan didn’t drive, did he? Alan is finally calling an Uber. 

It’s novel at first; then, merely fun. And eventually, every dinner becomes the same miasmic blend of new American cuisine and late-stage capitalism: Soft selling, done with a signature old-fashioned; introductions and icebreaker questions and bad jokes that elicit that polite office laugher—the [golf clap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D4OQaaWqH8) for corporate comedians—over a little gem salad; LinkedIn QR codes, shared with with a slice of flourless chocolate cake.

It’s easy to become a cynic about the entire thing. It's easy to sleepwalk through conferences, to go through the motions and say they’re all mostly meaningless, and to shoot spitballs on Substack and social media. Pessimism is cool these days.

I think that's a mistake. Sure, there are perfunctory rituals at every conference; there are boring talks and off-the-shelf happy hours. But among them—and in many ways, because of them—there is something deeply useful. You just have to pay close attention to see it. 

[Tim Urban reminds us](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1367871165319049221) that the hallowed ground of our lives is not the trail behind us, but [the open field in front of us](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-past-is-not-precious#:~:text=All%20we%20have%20to%20do%20is%20realize%20that%20the%20most%20hallowed%20ground%20is%20not%20the%20trail%20behind%20us%2C%20but%20the%20open%20field%20in%20front%20of%20us.):

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b55a5b4b-8ad3-4051-8ace-86399a2cff4c_1424x1428.png)

This maze of opportunity is both freeing—there is so much we could do; there is so much possibility out there—and paralyzing. Given the splintering timelines in front of us, how can we choose which one to pursue? How do we order from an endlessly scrolling menu? How do we navigate through an eternal fractal of tributaries, when we can’t even see [what’s around one riverbend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do5TwE_jYnE)?

*By going to conferences.* For all of their nihilistic ills—the thinly-veiled sales pitches, the repetitive dinners, the performative enthusiasm—professional conferences have at least one profound virtue: They can give us a glimpse into our own future. 

Because, by the end of it all, most of our lives and careers won’t be *that *unique; we will do something, in rough measure, that someone else has already done. Whether we mean to or not, we are all following in someone’s footsteps. And if we sail with the current of our present careers; if we take the promotions that we’re offered; if we apply to the jobs for which we’re comfortably qualified; if we respond to the recruiters who email us; if we stay in *this* arena; if we let our lives bounce like the puck on a Plinko board, moving from one adjacency to the next and never jumping to some distant discontinuity—if we live our professional lives like that, the person who we’re following—and more pointedly, the person who we’re *becoming—*isn’t just out there, somewhere in the world. They’re in here, among us, at this conference.

In other words, conferences aren’t just our professional connections and friends, [all in one place](https://benn.substack.com/p/all-in-one-place); they’re also our parallel lives, all at one time. They are the potential destinations of the mazes that are in front of us. The 40 people at the vendor dinner, the 200 people at happy hour, the 1,000 attendees in the audience of the keynote, the single person on stage presenting the keynote—for better or for worse, these are our options. 

There will be people who became managers; people who become executives; people who became CEOs. There will be startup founders, venture capitalists, independent consultants, “fractional CXOs,” “serial entrepreneurs,” and “LinkedIn Top Voices.” There will be people who became junior executives, prioritized their professional ambition, and are rich and recently divorced. There will be people who became middle managers, prioritized their life outside of work, and spend every evening with their kids.[^4] There will be people who had one more startup in them; people who went back into school; people who returned to Apple after trying to build a startup studio. There will be people who are on their tenth job and people who’ve been at Microsoft for 30 years. There will be lifelong marketers, career academics, and burned-out founders. There will be engineers turned product managers; analysts turned data engineers; baristas turned sales VPs; MBAs turned CEOs; CEOs turned baristas.[^5] 

Who are you drawn to? Who are you jealous of; whose shoes would you be proud to walk in in ten years? Are you inspired by the former marketing VP who took a pay cut to become a PM, and is now a chief product officer? Are you enchanted by the life of an engineer working on open source projects inside of Google? Do you envy the woman who works at LVMH, the man who works for the Detroit Lions, the person who was the chief data scientist of the United States? Do you wish that you were one of the scrappy founders selling themselves to a panel of VCs at the conference’s “Startup Battlefield?” Do you wish you were one of the VCs? 

Or do you wish that you were a million miles from all of it, and [retch at the thought](https://www.tiktok.com/@jasonritter1980/video/7173010975447207211) of still being here in ten years?

*That’s* what conferences are for: For showing us how wide-ranging a profession can be, while reminding us it is not infinite. If necessity is the mother of invention, boundaries are the mother of intention. It's hard to know what you want to eat without a menu; it's hard to know what you want to be without options. That's what we're sharing over our rosemary gin and tonics: The career paths that are available to us. And that's what the speakers on stage are teaching us: Who we will become if we're successful. Choose your fighter.

Most of the time, the winding rivers in front of us are hidden from our view. They are borderless and undefined, a gradient of uncertainty that we can only look around one riverbend at a time. But from the skies above places like Las Vegas, Orlando, and Austin, we can catch a glimpse of the entire river basin. We can see each professional tributary; we can see the people who are rafting down them; we can see where they each lead; we can decide which one we want to take, or if we'd rather [change everything](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-past-is-not-precious#:~:text=A%20couple%20years%20ago%2C%20a%20good%20friend%20of%20mine%20told%20me%20something%20that%20stuck%20with%20me%20ever%20since.%20%E2%80%9CIf%20someone%20really%20wanted%20to%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9Cthey%20could%20completely%20change%20their%20life%20in%2048%20hours.%E2%80%9D) and spend our one precious life exploring a new watershed. 

So as you leave, [open the plane’s window](https://benn.substack.com/p/open-the-window). Look back; pay attention. Who are you becoming? Who do you want to become?

[^2]: I’m sure I will get emails telling me I’m wrong. Which, great! I’m not saying every talk is forgotten, or that there isn’t somebody out there who took a picture of a slide and then actually did something useful with it later. I’m sure that this happens, and [it happened to me at least once](https://benn.substack.com/i/125542540/the-kroto-method). But it seems like the exception and not the rule.

[^3]: Is this cynical? Absolutely. But c’mon, we love this sort of stuff. We build apps to summarize [podcasts](https://app.scribbler.so/) and [emails](https://superhuman.com/ai); we want to learn physics [via TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@neildegrassetyson); we [carry around books around for the brand](https://www.workingtheorys.com/i/141554109/books-are-the-new-athleisure). We are lifelong learners, so long as the learning doesn’t take more than 30 seconds or 280 characters. [As SBF said](https://web.archive.org/web/20221027180943/https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-spotlight/), in a point that I suspect a lot of people quietly agree with, “I’m very skeptical of books. …I think, if you wrote a book, you fucked up, and it should have been a six-paragraph blog post.”
