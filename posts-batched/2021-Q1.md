# Social media's runaway train

*We either give in to the ride, or dismantle the track.*

Tear social media down. 

Last June, Michael Solana, a VC at Founder’s Fund, said—I think—the same thing. In a [frantic essay](https://www.piratewires.com/p/jump-23d06adb4cb7) on misinformation and mass hysteria, he warned that social media may one day compel the entire world, in a fit of rage and blinding groupthink, to jump in the air and land at once, dislodging the earth (metaphorically, not [scientifically](https://what-if.xkcd.com/8/)) from orbit and sending us all spiraling into oblivion. Though Solana didn’t explicitly call for bulldozing social media, it’s hard not to read his piece as a choice between it and us.

Since then, two cataclysmic events—the January 6th attack on the Capitol and the Gamestop circus last week—have made that choice even more stark. As they made clear, knocking the world off its axis takes far less than “a billion people...in a temporary state of madness.” All it takes is social media, at a global scale, operating as intended.

Both events trace similar outlines: Internet forums frothed up crowds of people with stories about evil cabals shutting them out of the halls of power. Partly out of [righteous anger](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/) and partly just to troll the system, the crowds conspired to take action. On their days of reckoning, egged on by the most powerful people in their worlds—the literal president of the United States in one case and the literal richest man in the world in the other—they sacked the superlative centers of their ire. And while neither fully succeeded—Biden is our president, everyone in Congress is still alive, [hedge funds still won](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401405-senvest-is-big-gamestop-winner-trading-large-discount-to-nav)—both put cracks in America’s institutional bedrock.

Of course, there were obvious and important differences. The bedrock attacked on January 6th was democracy itself, and the drill was murderous violence. The rioters were also, as Solana predicted, motivated by conspiracy and lies. 

We’ve known about these dangers for a while. It’s not controversial to say that social media spreads misinformation and breeds extremism. If the entire world can be every liar's and grifter's mark, at some point we're all going to get conned. The 2016 election made that painfully clear. 

The Gamestop saga, while not exactly noble, certainly leans more towards justice than sedition. WallStreetBets, the Reddit community at the center of the whole spectacle, moved against an unquestionably unfair, if not outright corrupt, financial system. The forum’s members weren’t driven by misinformation, but by a desire to outwit financiers at their own game, while making some money along the way. Though there was a conspiracy of sorts—if you put all your money into Gamestop, you’ll get rich—if enough people acted on it, it became true.

In other words, WallStreetBets’ conspiracy, true to its progenitors’ crypto-loving form, was decentralized. The January 6th rioters failed to overthrow the U.S. government in part because they put their faith in some central authority—Trump, Q, [Dan Crenshaw skydiving](https://twitter.com/DanCrenshawTX/status/1338184981684908033) out of *Mission: Impossible*—to overturn the election and tar everyone in Congress for being pedophiles, or something. True to *his form*, Trump didn’t show up, and his attempted coup turned into a lot of milling about. Had the plan, such as there was one, not relied on central action—had QAnon been built on an army of faceless insiders modeled after Guy Fawkes or Robert Paulson, had “we all been Q”—the rioters may well have burned the building down. 

WallStreetBets didn’t need anyone other than themselves to show up. When celebrity ringleaders arrived, like Chamath Palihapitiya dropping $150,000 on Gamestop stock and [selling a day later](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3655005-chamath-palihapitiya-closes-out-gamestop-call-position) just as all of Reddit was declaring “[HOLD THE LINE!](https://globalnews.ca/news/7604872/reddit-gamestop-wallstreetbets-hold-the-line/),” the show went on, sustained by the momentum of the story and the hordes of onlookers flocking to it.

Though the SEC may eventually disagree, as a social media community, WallStreetBets operated *exactly as it was supposed to*. It brought together people with similar hobbies to trade stories, tell jokes, and eventually, root for each other in the fight of their collective lives. It was a community, organizing. The best way to summarize the whole affair may come from Margaret Mead’s famous line that’s more often used as cheap background noise in college voter registration drives than to describe the mobilization of irreverent day traders: “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”

Consequently, the story became larger than Redditors banding together to get rich off of some comically bad hedge fund positions; it became a “[populist revolution](https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-wallstreetbets-reddit-trader-mania-populist-movement-occupy-wall-street-2021-1),” irresistible to [Ted Cruz and AOC](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905) alike. (Hedge funds are more agreed upon enemies than Nazis, apparently.) Rather than left versus right or right versus wrong, it was [insiders versus outsiders](https://www.persuasion.community/p/the-insiders-game)—and everyone loves an underdog.

But decentralized is not the same as [democratic](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1355580731980869637), and outsiders are not the same as the masses. Compared to the earthquake it caused, WallStreetBets was a small community—prior to last week, WallStreetBets was [roughly the size](https://www.businessinsider.com/wallstreetbets-fastest-growing-subreddit-hits-58-million-users-2021-1) of [Jill Stein’s base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election#Results)—and an even less representative one. Though there’s no way to know who its members are for sure, the group’s style of humor and its overlapping subreddits (according to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/style/gamestop-wallstreetbets-reddit.html), the top 20 are about finance, crypto, gambling, and one called FrugalMaleFashion) strongly suggests it’s mostly young men. 

Their success came not from the breadth of their appeal, but from, as Margaret Mead predicted, the commitment to their cause. It turns out, to make the world wobble, a lot fewer people have to jump than we thought.

That, ultimately, is what ties January 6th and Gamestop together: Despite their motivating ideas remaining essentially fringe, the scale of the platforms on which they grew made it possible for each movement to attract a critical mass of true believers willing to risk their livelihoods to turn their online cause into a very real one. 

Though passions like these are not new, with global social media platforms, all forms of people can now find each other at staggering scale and speed. Want to find 80,000 other people interested in [vintage baseball photos](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1875393279364705)? It took me 45 seconds. Want to find tens of thousands of men who’ve turned their dating frustrations into a dangerous hatred of women? Though I’d rather not Google it, I’m certain I could find incel communities faster than I could find a misplaced set of keys. And want to find a million people willing to YOLO significant portions of their life savings on some Gamestop stock? [It took less than 6 months](https://twitter.com/endtwist/status/1354554173610749952), which, as far as paradigm-altering revolutions go, is the blink of an eye.

Though it’s hard not to root for the Redditors—I mean, [how could you not](https://www.tiktok.com/@geosaris/video/6922517427939069190)—January 6th showed that every movement won’t be so well-meaning. Or, as the case may yet be with WallStreetBets, something that begins with the best intentions can spiral out of control. Curious observers can get “[caught up in the moment](https://ktla.com/news/nationworld/i-got-caught-up-in-the-moment-man-photographed-hanging-from-senate-balcony-asks-for-forgiveness/)” and become revolutionaries—like [Elizabeth, from Knoxville, Tennessee](https://twitter.com/hunterw/status/1346919171595137025?lang=en), who seems as likely to take a selfie with Mike Pence as try to kill him, and me, who went from checking the stock market once a week to pinning GME, Gamestop’s ticker’s symbol, on my Chrome tab bar the moment I bought a few shares. 

There could also be more threatening aftershocks. After Robinhood, the popular trading app used by most of WallStreetBets, shut down trading on GME last week, hedge fund schadenfreude turned to genuine outrage, and the outrage [turned conspiratorial](https://twitter.com/_benkaufman/status/1355170536909922305). The real reasons behind Robinhood’s actions (they [claim innocence](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week)) probably aren’t that material: Given the [concentricit](https://www.amazon.com/Culture-Warlords-Journey-White-Supremacy-ebook/dp/B084FXPHM3)y between other male-domintated Reddit communities (gaming, dating) and white supremacy, there’s a well-worn groove that could connect WallStreetBets to Rosthchildian antisemitism. If enough people find each other—which they almost certainly will, especially if GME comes [back to earth](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-28/knowing-when-to-sell-gamestop-stock-at-the-top-is-impossible) and Reddit’s diamond hand warriors are the ones holding the bag—off we’ll go again.

Off we’ll go, careening down an uncertain track on a runaway train captained by a rotating cast of hijackers—some who mean well, some who don’t, and most of whom [just](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/world/europe/boaty-mcboatface-what-you-get-when-you-let-the-internet-decide.html) [think](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/22/asia/k-pop-fandom-activism-intl-hnk/index.html) [it’s](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/austin-solid-waste-fred-durst_n_822082?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAG8AXXcgoJEN1wpNOL1_4KMk4jHFbpieoM9hA5LQJYwVsOh7yfDiYz-9NQ_2AKIHIFDpeQMKzikOiFt2pCLjfVw6ztJV6jXXoMneAnmbMe2eiK655hv41sTfcUCm9DjyqH4bUg6A0E3Ift9NoR_QFYAvt0hTp2TaFPIo9C7-CsXT) [funny](https://mashable.com/2012/07/17/pitbull-is-going-to-alaska/). 

At this point, we have two choices: Give in to the ride, or dismantle the entire track. 

The state can’t commandeer the train; plenty of authoritarian regimes have made the dangers of that deadly clear. Targeted solutions like moderation and deplatforming—though clearly effective in preventing a [second coup attempt](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/us/anti-biden-protests.html)—are temporary, impossible to administer, and, most of all, require repeat offenders or dangerous content. As WallStreetBets showed us, chaos requires neither.

Perhaps, the problem is simpler. Perhaps, just as a society in which we’re all issued an assault rifle when we turn twelve is an inherently dangerous one, a society in which anyone can find and talk to everyone in an instant is an inherently unstable one. Perhaps, just because we can build it, doesn’t mean we should. 

Undoubtedly, social media has social benefits. And it may, in the long run, arc us towards a more equitable—and, frankly, fun—world. But, to borrow from a [gleeful Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4wh03/we_fucking_did_it_bois/) watching the world turn upside down and paraphrase John Maynard Keynes, social media may stay irrational longer than we can remain fixed in a habitable orbit.

As an extended footnote, it’s hard not to see the Gamestop story, like so much else in America, as being tinted by race. Rather than comparing the event to January 6th, you could also compare it to the Black Lives Matter protests: In both, people, angry about a system rigged against them, organized and rose up in collective against that system’s worst actors to take back the power that’s been stolen from them, prompting a panic among the elite and revealing deep, fundamental flaws in once-venerable institutions at the heart of our society.

But in many circles, it was the Reddit “protest”—the carnival, the irreverent joke turned unexpected allegory—that drew more unqualified praise. 

Was it their methods? WallStreetBets was [celebrated](https://www.persuasion.community/p/the-insiders-game) for responding to financial pillage with even more financial pillage: “The only way to beat a rigged game is to rig it even harder.” In the face of corporeal pillage, Black Lives Matter protesters would’ve been condemned or killed for responding in kind—which [they didn’t](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/16/this-summers-black-lives-matter-protesters-were-overwhelming-peaceful-our-research-finds/), but were blamed for anyway.

Was it “[property damage](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8740609/Rioting-140-cities-George-Floyds-death-cost-insurance-industry-2-BILLION.html)?” The whole point of the Gamestop trade was property damage. The more Reddit siphoned billions away from hedge funds, the more they were commended (and their tally is estimated to be [$19 billion](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/short-sellers-sitting-on-19-billion-of-losses-on-gamestop-data-shows-2021-1-1030020684), nearly ten times the [estimated damage](https://www.axios.com/riots-cost-property-damage-276c9bcc-a455-4067-b06a-66f9db4cea9c.html) from the events surrounding the protests.) With Redditors [reveling in how ](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/podcasts/the-daily/gamestop-stock-robinhood-reddit.html)*[high ](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/podcasts/the-daily/gamestop-stock-robinhood-reddit.html)*[a price](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/podcasts/the-daily/gamestop-stock-robinhood-reddit.html) they paid for GME, it’s clear this wasn’t about their gains, which will mostly deflate with the stock price anyway, but about hedge fund losses. 

No, the condemnation of Black Lives Matter’s tactics and the celebration of Reddit’s was yet another reminder that no matter how solemn the stand or profound the problem, black people’s protests will never be sober enough. It’s almost as if the problem isn’t the protest, but the protestors. But of course, [we already knew that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J39umNuQjMs).

# A slur on Clubhouse

*Will we look this time?*

---

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wgiI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00551f92-4ce6-48e3-8f63-5102c3b03d0e_1200x480.jpeg)

We all know the story by now. 

Last weekend, Taylor Lorenz, a *New York Times* tech reporter, was listening to a conversation on Clubhouse, a popular new app for tech celebrities to have conference calls with one another in front of a live audience. (For full disclosure, I’ve never been able to use the app, which is only available on iOS. If losing half of my text messages to iMessage’s infinity loop isn’t enough to compel me to stop using an Android, an app that’s premier content is a live broadcast a16z’s content marketing standup won’t make me an iPhone user either.)

During last week’s discussion, Lorenz, who’s been a [vocal critic](https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-where-are-the-adults-in-the-clubhouse/) of what she sees as an emerging culture of harassment on the app, tweeted an accusation that venture capitalist Marc Andreessen used the “r-word” in reference to the [Gamestop drama](https://benn.substack.com/p/runaway-train) on Reddit. Lorenz had misheard—the speaker was Ben Horowitiz, Andreessen Horowitz’s other eponymous founder.

People rushed to correct the record, to accuse Lorenz of lying to advance some personal vendetta against the tech elite, and to use the moment to push their own agendas about ongoing soap opera between tech and the media. All the usual players recycled their usual lines. Glenn Greenwald repackaged an [old rant](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/demanding-silicon-valley-suppress) calling the *New York Times* a tattletale hall monitor into a [new rant](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/the-journalistic-tattletale-and-censorship) calling the *New York Times* a tattletale hall monitor. Bari Weiss [shared](https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1358476610333143041) Glenn Greenwald’s article, and then [retweeted](https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1358598304330747908) her own Twitter “exposé” of the *Times*’ culture—in which she was, fittingly, [accused](https://twitter.com/donmoyn/status/1268650212266049537?lang=en) of mischaracterizing conversations to fit her own narrative. The Daily Caller [intimated](https://twitter.com/ChuckRossDC/status/1358411936682115074) that Lorenz’s tweet was part of an organized purge unfolding at *Times*. Olivia Nuzzi [subtweeted](https://twitter.com/Olivianuzzi/status/1358460167420010499) some stuff about civility. 

The predictable melodrama gave the whole affair the feel of a WWE wrestling match: Everyone threw their punches, dropped their signature moves to the delight of their fans, and nobody got hurt. Our champions picked up some likes and followers, and all of us in the audience had something to keep us entertained until [this week’s](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/technology/slate-star-codex-rationalists.html) Monday Night Raw.

Throughout the dust up, an Eminen lyric kept running through my head: “[Your reply got the crowd yelling, “Woo! / so before you die let’s see who can out-petty who.](https://genius.com/Eminem-killshot-lyrics)”

The line is from Eminem’s diss track “[Killshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killshot_(song)),” which is a response to Machine Gun Kelly’s diss track “[Rap Devil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rap_Devil),” which itself is a response to Eminem’s diss of MGK on “[Not Alike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Alike).” Though I have no idea how Eminem and MKG actually feel about one another, it’s hard not to read the line as acknowledging the feud is an exaggerated charade, designed to make a mountain of publicity out of a molehill of a disagreement. (Eminem promises exactly this to MKG in “Killshot,” saying “you're a fuckin' mole hill / Now I'ma make a mountain out of you.”) And a mountain they make: “[Killshot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxQTY-W6GIo)” and “[Rap Devil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp0BScQSSvg)” both have over 300 million views on YouTube. 

The incessant drama on Clubhouse has worked equally as well. The app now has over [6 million users](https://backlinko.com/clubhouse-users), is valued at over $1 billion dollars, and tech personalities are [racking](https://twitter.com/NaithanJones/status/1357007622717767680) [up](https://twitter.com/ErikaBatista/status/1356568104332124160) [followers](https://twitter.com/HarryStebbings/status/1336839228920094724).

In this most recent scuffle, Lorenz took the show a bit too far. But it would be far from the first time someone’s overstepped, and if anything, drawing a bit of real blood whips up each side’s fans even more. If engineer-turned-Twitter-shock-jock Slava Akhmechet can routinely [say and delete](https://gist.github.com/travisbrown/059310042193a2e143408b05bdc2278d) misogynist [nonsense](https://web.archive.org/web/20201201012205/https://twitter.com/spakhm/status/1333514691533025284?s=21) and still be followed by people like Paul Graham, it’s probably safe to say that Lorenz won’t lose many fans either. Rather than getting riled up by any of this, maybe we should choose our teams and enjoy the show.

But, maybe not.

Maybe that easy cynicism is exactly the problem. Maybe both sides *aren’t* embellishing their rage. Maybe Lorenz’s tweet wasn’t a pantomimed punch that accidentally landed, but was a real outburst, born of furious despair. Maybe it was a reminder that, in this apparent theater, one side isn’t always acting.

Eminem’s lyric wasn't the only quote I couldn’t shake as I was watching everything unfold last week. The other line came from Jia Tolentino, and another story about an overreaching reporter.

In 2014, the *Rolling Stone *published “[A Rape on Campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rape_on_Campus),” a long story alleging that a freshman at the University of Virginia, identified only as Jackie, had been brutally raped at a frat house. The story, written by seasoned journalist Sabrina Erdely, was presented as the very violent and graphic tip of an iceberg of sexual violence on college campuses. 

As Tolentino documents in her book *Trick Mirror, *the story blew up—twice. Within hours of its publication, it exploded virally, becoming, according to Tolentino, the most-read non-celebrity story in *Rolling Stone*’s history. But nearly as quickly, people started picking apart the story’s details. It began to unravel, and within weeks, it imploded. Jackie’s allegation, though possibly rooted in an actual assault, had been grossly exaggerated. Though Erdely noticed discrepancies in her narrative, she pushed ahead anyway, apparently swayed by her sympathy for the Jackie, her recognition that trauma makes memories inexact, and her desire to expose the rot in a system that routinely fails to protect sexual assault victims. *Rolling Stone* issued a full retraction.

The backlash was far-reaching, directed not only at Erdely, Jackie, and the *Rolling Stone*, but also at anyone [trying to raise awareness about sexual assault](https://www.delawareonline.com/story/opinion/contributors/2014/12/09/rolling-stone-may-crushed-anti-rape-bill/20148205/). To those who want to pretend these issues don’t exist, the article proved to be the perfect way to [tar real victims as lying opportunists](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/12/14/campus-rape-uva-crisis-rolling-stone-politics-column/20397277/). 

Trying to make sense of it, and of her own anger at both Erdely and Jackie, Tolentino comes to this conclusion: “I hate the dirty river I’m standing in, not the journalist and the college student who capsized in it.” 

Tolentino then quotes Elizabeth Schambelan [writing on the same subject](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-28/essays/league-of-men/) in *n+1*:

> This is the story I’ve come up with, about the story Jackie told: she did it out of rage. She had no idea she was enraged, but she was. Something had happened, and she wanted to tell other people, so that they would know what happened and know how she felt. But when she tried to tell it — maybe to somebody else, maybe to herself — the story had no power. It didn’t sound, in the telling, anything like what it *felt* like in the living. It sounded ordinary, mundane, eminently forgettable, like a million things that had happened to a million other women — but that wasn’t what it felt like to her. What it felt like was lurid and strange and violent and violating. I have no idea what it was, whether a crime was involved. There’s a perfectly legal thing called hogging, where guys deliberately seek out sex partners they find unattractive so they can laugh about it later with their friends. Maybe it was something like that, or maybe it was much milder, an expression of contempt that was avuncular, unthinking, something that transformed her into a thing without even meaning to. Whatever it was, this proximate cause, she didn’t know what to do about it...
> I want to condemn it, and I do condemn it, but I also think I can guess what she was saying, or would have said, which can’t be said reasonably. It must be said melodramatically. Something like: Look at this. Don’t you fucking dare not look. I’m going to make you look. I’m going to make you know. You’re going to know what we’ve decided is worth sacrificing, what price we’ve decided we’re willing to pay to maintain this league of men, and this time, you’re going to remember.

Jackie was broken by a system that refused to listen to her. She was broken by the men who told her that her pain, pain they both caused and could never feel, wasn’t important. Her lie wasn’t revenge or false narrative; it was desperate, dying rage.

Just as it’s easy for us to see Jackie as being solely responsible for the story she made up, it’s easy for us to chastise Lorenz, and Lorenz alone, for her false accusation. But we can’t dismiss it as an unhinged tantrum or a calculated hit job of a politically motivated reporter. We *know* what women put up with on social media, especially those who work in technology. Lorenz herself has been trying to get people to [pay attention](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/instagram-has-massive-harassment-problem/572890/) since at least 2018. And overwhelmingly, she, like so many other victims of online harassment, has been [accused of being an immature hysteric](https://savingjournalism.substack.com/p/taylor-lorenz-an-ag-sulzberger-production), a woman who didn’t see what she saw, a woman who didn’t feel what she felt. Overwhelmingly, she’s been told that nobody is going to look.

We should read Lorenz’s tweet in *that* context—and those who criticize Lorenz and the cancel culture that they claim she represents are nothing if not [advocates](https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1358785880949940227) of [context](https://twitter.com/anush_vinod/status/1358634653884633089). Wrong as it was, Lorenz’s misplaced accusation doesn’t diminish the harassment she has to routinely deal with, nor does it make the bullies who harass her innocent. And those who downplay that harassment shouldn’t act so sanctimonious—or so innocent—when, after years of using inside voices, harassment victims’ patience [turns to rage](https://twitter.com/triketora/status/1360559254084722689). If you’re going to question Lorenz’s motivation for tweeting the fiction that she did, you should also question your own motivation for ignoring the truth she’s been trying to tell you for so long.

# The misleading math of a startup wealth tax

*An Excel butterfly flaps its wings. *

![Elizabeth Warren Campaign Stalled: What Went Wrong | Time](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5rZ2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F026ca32c-4294-4ead-b003-8e927c536fd1_4000x2667.jpeg)

For people wondering how to pay for Biden’s $1.9 trillion economic aid package, [Elizabeth Warren has a plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/business/elizabeth-warren-wealth-tax.html): Last week, she proposed creating an annual 2 percent tax on the net worth of anyone with more than $50 million in assets, with an additional 1 percent tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. According to Warren, the legislation would raise $2.75 trillion over ten years.

Though the plan is [supported by a majority of Democrats and Republicans](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/business/economy/economy-politics-survey.html), Silicon Valley’s venture class responded to similar proposals with predictable denouncements. A wealth tax [reduces the upside](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1366445681251123214) of a starting a successful company; a wealth tax [dilutes the amount of control](https://www.dispatch.com/opinion/20191030/column-wealth-tax-would-discourage-entrepreneurs-and-startups) founders’ have over the companies they start; a wealth tax [shrinks the pool](https://www.inc.com/sharon-poczter/why-wealth-tax-would-almost-assuredly-slow-startup-growth-in-america.html) of angel investors who can fund “innovation;” a wealth tax [would push startup employees](https://medium.com/cicero-news/the-wealth-tax-is-a-terrible-idea-3e333572d2be) worth tens of millions of dollars to the brink of bankruptcy, bankruptcy they “will have to forfeit shares” (i.e,, their wealth) to stay out of, which, well, seems like the whole point of a wealth tax.

In a [short post](http://paulgraham.com/wtax.html) from last summer, YC founder Paul Graham put some numbers to his argument. According to Graham’s math, a successful startup founder would lose 65 percent of their wealth to Warren’s tax plan over the course of their life. (Graham excludes the billionaire surcharge in his calculations; for consistency, [my model](https://gist.github.com/bstancil/4d21c58981b60d08119c3002c3e5ea89) excludes it as well.) The number seems striking, especially when compared to Warren’s description of the plan as a modest “two cent tax.”

Graham’s number isn’t wrong—it’s irrelevant. 

Graham presents his calculations as representative of a “successful startup.” And at first glance, his assumptions sound reasonable enough: A founder starts with $2 million dollars worth of equity in their company. Their shares grow “3x for 2 years, then 2x for 2 years, then 50% for 2 years, after which you just get a typical public company growth rate, which we'll call 8%.” Graham assumes the founder starts young ([this is Paul Graham](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/19/op-ed-myths-about-what-entrepreneurs-are-like.html), after all), so he runs the simulation for sixty years.

But together, these assumptions compound in profound ways. If you play out Graham’s scenario without a wealth tax, his hypothetical founder will be worth *$10.3 billion* at the end of their life. That’s good enough to be the [48th richest person](https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/) in the United States in 2020—and exactly as rich as Gordon Moore, the 91-year-old founder of Intel, one of the most successful tech companies of all time. It’s several spots higher than WhatsApp founder Jan Koum, who [owned an estimated 45 percent of his company](https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/02/19/exclusive-inside-story-how-jan-koum-built-whatsapp-into-facebooks-new-19-billion-baby/?sh=12db416f2fa1) (an astronomically high share) when it was acquired by Facebook for $22 billion in the [eighth largest tech acquisition](https://www.businessinsider.com/chart-the-biggest-tech-acquisitions-in-history-alongside-tiktok-2020-8#8-facebook-bought-whatsapp-in-2014-for-22-billion-21) ever.

These are outcomes on the absolute edges of what a startup founder can achieve. To present them as somehow typical—and the tax implications as being of any consequence to most founders—is deeply misleading.

Ironically, Graham falls victim to the exact problem he warns about, and that Silicon Valley [is supposed to be good at](https://twitter.com/schlaf/status/1236379538814316549): Exponential growth is extraordinarily sensitive to seemingly insignificant changes. Graham makes three aggressive, though plausible, assumptions that, when compounded over many years and combined with the volatile growth dynamics of a startup, lead to a wildly implausible conclusion.

### Long time horizons

Graham assumes that his startup founder lives for sixty years *after* accumulating $2 million in wealth. In the United States, at what age are people expected to live sixty more years? *[18](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html)*. Even if Graham’s founder lives ten years longer than average, that requires them to be worth $2 million at age 28, [two years younger than the average YC founder](https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-winter-2018-stats/). Given Graham’s [skepticism](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/magazine/y-combinator-silicon-valleys-start-up-machine.html) of older founders, even that age is unrepresentative: Researchers found that the average age of [successful founders is actually 45](https://hbr.org/2018/07/research-the-average-age-of-a-successful-startup-founder-is-45). For those founders, wealth would likely accumulate for thirty to forty years, not sixty.

These shorter time horizons give wealth taxes less time to accumulate. Leaving all of Graham’s other assumptions in place (including the assumption that tax policy remains unchanged for decades), Warren’s tax plan would reduce a founder’s wealth by 23 percent over twenty years, 37 percent over thirty years, 48 percent over forty years, and 57 percent over fifty years.

### Front-loaded growth rates

Graham assumes that a lot of growth comes early in his startup’s life. Rather than growing steadily, the value of his founder’s shares triple for two consecutive years, double for two years, grow by 50 percent for two years, and then grow at 8 percent a year for the next 54 years. These initial growth rates mirror the “[triple, triple, double, double, double](https://www.battery.com/powered/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/)” rule of thumb that venture capitalists use to benchmark startups. Under this rule, startups hoping to be worth at least $1 billion should, after reaching $1 million in revenue, aim to triple revenue for each of the next two years and double revenue for each of the following three years.

Though startups do grow faster early in their lives, this rule isn’t particularly realistic. Great companies can be built over a slower, steadier pace. Shopify, [the largest tech company founded after 2005](https://companiesmarketcap.com/tech/largest-tech-companies-by-market-cap/), [never tripled its revenue once](https://medium.com/surepath-library/forget-what-vcs-tell-you-about-growth-7858f68fe21b), much less twice. (It’s worth noting that Graham is talking about valuation growth rates, not revenue growth rates, so they aren’t directly comparable. However, early-stage founders [lose a good portion of their equity to dilution](https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/hotshot-ceo-aaron-levie-will-only-own-5-7-of-box-when-it-ipos-investor-dfj-owns-25-5/). For Graham’s founder’s wealth to grow at his assumed rate, the company’s valuation would have to rise even faster.)

These initial growth rates front-load the founder’s wealth accumulation. This pushes them over the taxable threshold quickly and, more meaningfully, ensures that their wealth tax bill compounds over a longer period of time. Slower initial growth, even if perfectly offset by terminal growth faster than 8 percent, has a significant impact on the final tax burden.

This effect is particularly visible on the extremes. Under Graham’s growth scenario, a founder loses 64 percent of their wealth. If, instead, the startup grew steadily by 15 percent a year for sixty years, they would pay out 46 percent over the same period. On the other extreme, if all the growth came in year one—essentially, if the founder’s wealth was inherited—they would be taxed a total 70 percent of their wealth.

### Rapid growth rates

If one share of Graham’s startup was worth $1 at the beginning of his simulation, that same share would be worth $1,108 after forty years. If you bought $1 of Apple stock forty years ago in 1981, those shares would be worth about $1,200 today.

In other words, Graham’s startup is growing at the same rate as Apple—[the most valuable company in the world](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk01YrnKJueYImH9i6IGBXj4OmlPL-Q%3A1615216847601&ei=z0BGYI2dJNGb5gKkj6SICQ&q=most+valuable+company+in+the+world&oq=most+valuable+company+in+the+world&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBAgjECcyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BwgAEEcQsAM6BwgjELECECc6BggAEAcQHlD0OVi2PGDsQmgEcAF4AIABaYgBvwKSAQMzLjGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEIwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwjNwL7T_6DvAhXRjVkKHaQHCZEQ4dUDCA4&uact=5) and not exactly a typical “successful startup.” 

More reasonable growth rates make Warren’s wealth tax much less onerous. Reducing growth rates by about a third would still put the founder on track to be a billionaire in today’s tax environment, but lower the burden of a wealth tax from 64 percent to 52 percent. For founders who only achieve the “modest” wealth of $100 million, which would put them in the [richest few thousand households](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2014/financial-institutions-business-unit-strategy-global-wealth-2014-riding-wave-growth) in the country, their tax burden would be 11 percent—a tax bill, by the way, that would be paid over the course of sixty years. 

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8_tA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F279c92a1-bd04-4974-826d-9cb86a2740c3_1200x356.png)

A more realistic scenario would temper all three dimensions: The founder’s wealth would grow more slowly, more evenly, and over a shorter period of time. Just as these assumptions compound up, they also compound down.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_V39!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f23059b-0e57-4bf9-92cf-d603cebcd4e1_1600x549.png)

Across these scenarios, a founder could accumulate over $100 million in assets while paying an effective wealth tax rate as low as 5 percent and as high as 56 percent. *And ultimately, that’s the point:* In a long-running exponential models like this, fiddling with a few assumptions can change the headline from “Founders to lose two-thirds of wealth to Warren’s tax plan” to “Founders worth $100 million barely affected by proposed wealth tax.” With such a range of possibilities available, anyone with an Excel spreadsheet can easily craft a story to fit their narrative. 

Consider, then, a final narrative: None of this math matters. These simple models are just a Rorschach test for pre-existing policy preferences. Graham’s calculations don’t tell us the hard truth about a wealth tax; they tell us Graham is opposed to a wealth tax, and he wants you to be opposed to it too. And anyone else who crunches a few numbers in a spreadsheet is doing the same thing.

Fair enough—I can use Excel too, and I see the ink blot differently. Here’s my headline: 230 years.  

If we accept Graham’s growth model, his hypothetical founder is worth $3.7 billion *after* applying Warren’s wealth tax. Suppose that founder passes their wealth to their children, who decide to do absolutely nothing with their money. They invest in nothing but a can under their mattress. They earn no return on it. They produce nothing with it, other than an annual 2 percent wealth tax bill.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Uoz7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95bccf6d-c938-4ae7-b450-51b698f763ee_1920x960.png)

This person would be a billionaire for 64 more years. They would be worth over $100 million *for 178 more years. *By Graham’s own math, even with Warren’s wealth tax, a founder who puts in six years of work—the six years they earn above-market growth rates—will be worth more than $100 million for 230 years. 

Either being worth $100 million for seven generations isn’t enough to “[motivate founders](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1366445681251123214),” or that number is bogus—and so is Graham’s 65 percent. Or maybe, Paul Graham is right: [money really isn’t the main goal](http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html). And if that’s the case, in a country that needs to “[attack poverty, and if necessary damage wealth in the process](http://paulgraham.com/ineq.html),” why stop at 2 percent?

A year from now, someone will write a great story about the class of 2021's college application essays. Not the good essays, but those written by white kids from northern Virginia and suburban Nashville and the entire state of Connecticut who try to fit a hand-me-down BMW, an annual family trip to Bermuda, and their intermittent participation in their church’s Adopt-a-Highway program into an answer to "How has overcoming adversity defined who you are today?"

In normal years, these essays are terrible. (I know because I wrote several of them, all of which have been mercifully lost to the corrupted hard drive of a Gateway 2000.) This year, they'll surely be much worse. If the white adults of 2020 are any indication, the white college applicants of 2020 will replace their strained stories of disadvantage with eager claims of privilege, pronouncing themselves awake, remorseful, and reformed. [I have been called out](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBJk0UGDY4P), they’ll say. [WE ARE THE PROBLEM](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBEUyDDF12C/). [i’m sorry please forgive me](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBJbkJ7M2Q5/). [I’ve failed](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBJ1RFAnthN). [WE DID NOT SPEAK UP](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBJPTPXpEh8/). Given how poorly PR professionals navigated these attempts at asking for credit by taking the blame, I feel for (and want to hear from) the college admissions officers who have to slog through thousands of teenage versions.

This genre of self-flagellations and confessions, though [often unhelpful and sometimes offensive](https://hyperallergic.com/568933/black-lives-matter-white-allies-social-media/), emerged as one of the ways white people responded to last summer’s protests. For better or for worse, this, I thought, was the new normal. 

Until it wasn’t. Last week, we found ourselves taking another trip around this awful merry-go-round of racial violence when a white man murdered eight people, six of whom were Asian women, in Atlanta. People quickly responded in ways similar to last summer: [standing with Asian communities](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23StopAsianHate), [organizing marches and protests](https://www.instagram.com/stopaapihate/), and [compelling people to educate themselves](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLflb7MJTPk/) that these murders are just a sharp edge to a long history of anti-Asian racism in the United States. 

But, so far at least, the apologies are missing. I haven’t seen any statements taking blame for “not doing enough” to stop what happened in Atlanta or the underlying disease that caused it. If anything, the posts in my feeds (which obviously represent a sliver of what’s being said, and perhaps a very unrepresentative one) that address who’s at fault suggest the opposite, demanding that “we” hold “people” who [stay silent accountable](https://twitter.com/m2jr/status/1372745923139280901).

I don’t know what to make of this difference. Superficially, it seems like a positive change—the world doesn’t need Anthropologie to chase Instagram likes with tone-deaf virtue signaling in serif fonts tastefully off-centered over a millennial pink square. But I’m skeptical that these posts disappeared because we’ve collectively matured beyond them. When it comes to anything to do with race, America hasn’t earned the benefit of the doubt.

One possible explanation is just time. The current moment is still raw, and people haven’t had time to manufacture their contrition just yet. In time, it might show up. 

But that seems incomplete, especially when you consider how permissible explicit anti-Asian racism still is. It’s hard to imagine that the United States has any sort of grasp on the systemic underpinnings of the murders in Atlanta when [mainstream news outlets still frequently trade in Asian tropes](https://twitter.com/isosteph/status/1373342242513985537).  

Perhaps, then, people are reluctant to apologize for anything because there’s no systemic shield for them to hide behind. To declare yourself as part of the problem vis-à-vis anti-Black racism in America is—or at least can be framed as—declaring yourself as unwittingly complicit in a system bigger than yourself. You can admit to a crime without admitting to a *specific* crime. 

If people don’t yet recognize anti-Asian racism as being structural, those who apologize for it have no cover. Those who admit guilt have to say what they’re guilty of. Vague confessions of weakness and inaction won’t do. So people point fingers (often at [other non-white groups](https://www.vox.com/22321234/black-asian-american-tensions-solidarity-history)), at least until taking blame is rewarded with a pat on the head.

It’s a hell of a trick, and revealing of how potent America’s racial caste system is. It can hide in the shadows of unfulfilled promises of equal protection, and the moment those at the top acknowledge its existence—which [Biden did in historic fashion during his inaugural address](https://qz.com/1960452/bidens-remark-about-white-supremacy-made-inauguration-history/)—many of them collectively and dramatically stand up like an inverted [Spartacus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKCmyiljKo0), protecting, even if inadvertently, [the embedded rot in the system](https://twitter.com/whstancil/status/1372320381369905152). 

In trying to understand the different reactions between the murders in Atlanta and the murders last summer, perhaps that’s the lesson: The only constant is the outcome. Racism in America isn’t defined by an ordered set of principles, but is shapeshifting and infinitely flexible, able to take whatever form is necessary to perpetuate it. Its apparent inconsistencies don’t undermine it, but make it stronger. You cannot take it apart with reason. You cannot pound the shape out of water.

Race and caste are not logic. They're an ugly, violent lie. And like any lie, it’s not held together by anything more coherent than the tangled web we weave to protect it.
