# Does venture capital ruin great products?

*It's at least a little strange how we assume that spending more money building something makes it worse.*

*[The $1 billion dollar version is usually better than the $1 version.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48h57PspBec)*

The modern data stack, we're now regularly told, is dead. There were many murderers. It was killed [by overcrowding](https://www.timextender.com/blog/data-empowered-leadership/the-modern-data-stack-is-broken). The Fed did it with [low interest rates](https://twitter.com/OnlyCFO/status/1709562739432272360). The Fed did it with [high interest rates](https://mattturck.com/mad2023-part-ii/). Vladimir Putin [did it](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/technology/tech-bubble.html#:~:text=the%20world%20is%20mobilizing%20to%20stop%20the%20invasion%20in%20Ukraine). Sam Bankman-Fried [did it](https://www.politico.eu/article/crypto-help-bring-down-svb-silicon-valley-bank-ftx/). It died in [two](https://davidsj.substack.com/p/the-modern-data-stack-is-dead-long) [parts](https://davidsj.substack.com/p/the-modern-data-stack-is-dead-long-61f). Reverse ETL [killed it](https://medium.com/@hugolu87/zero-elt-could-be-the-death-of-the-modern-data-stack-cfdd56c9246d). Usage fees and compute charges [billed it to death](https://www.polaranalytics.com/post/the-true-cost-of-building-a-data-stack-internally-for-ecommerce). It was murdered from inside the house, by the [naive hubris of inexperienced founders](https://www.reddit.com/r/depressedmemes/comments/10tlvy9/we_do_this_not_because_it_is_easy_but_because_we/). It died of natural causes and old age—animal spirits and hype cycles have short and searing lives, and aren’t made to last.

Of course, nobody really cares how it died, though. Who actually killed it—or if it is [even dead](https://twitter.com/mehd_io/status/1709923019781795958), or if [philosophical epochs](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-new-philosophers#:~:text=it%20represents%20the%20epochal%20sequel) can die at all—isn’t being investigated. Nobody is on the case; the *New York Times* won’t send us an alert in thirty years to tell us [it’s been solved](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/29/arts/music/tupac-shakur-murder-charge-arrest.html).[^1] Because we don’t talk about the death of the modern data stack to bring it to justice; we talk about it because we have something to sell—a counterculture product that is [oh-so-different](https://www.astralcodexten.com/i/67112750/phase-involution) from the status quo, a personal brand [to monetize](https://benn.substack.com/subscribe), a [Top Voice badge](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a776208) on LinkedIn—and nothing gets clicks like headlines about something being dead. If it bleeds, it generates leads. 

Still, whether they’re happening in cynical SEO bait on a corporate blog or in the comment section of a tabloid,[^2] these conversations matter, because narratives matter. Every post and Twitter thread adds a dot to our collective memory of what happened over the last few years; eventually, those dots will blur into a generally accepted pointillism. If the dots blaming founders dominate, that’s the story we’ll remember and tell; that’s who will be guilty in the court of common knowledge. Beware of young founders starting enterprise companies. Beware of companies built by data practitioners. The history we paint now—regardless of whether it’s right or wrong—is the history that we’ll remind and warn everyone else about in ten years. 

Though our painting of the murder is still incomplete, at least one theme is emerging: The VCs did it. The rough story here is well understood. Prior to 2019 or so, the modern data stack was a loose community of tools that aspired to move data products to the cloud. It was a pleasingly modern alternative to the clanky machinery sold to us by Oracle and others—an ergonomic upgrade; a cheaper way to work; a more accessible set of open technologies and languages. It was a set of tools born from the firsthand pain of the people who were creating them, by practitioners for practitioners. It had a short [short creed](https://docs.getdbt.com/community/resources/viewpoint) and, over time, a lot of [fervent converts](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/four-years-in-and-its-a-strange-time-celebrate). 

Then, the story goes, after the pandemic exploded and interest rates hit the floor, venture capitalists caught wind of the club. And not the pioneering VCs, but the kind who chase trends, who ask who else is on the cap table, and who are still looking for the [suckers who are inflating the bubble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4cXJERzFqM). For eighteen months, diligence went to zero, valuations went [to infinity](https://www.amazon.com/Going-Infinite-Rise-Fall-Tycoon/dp/1324074337), and a bunch of [crossover funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crossoverfund.asp) started cannoning money at every data startup they could find.[^3] The money, the narrative continues, cost companies their soul. User delight became an urgently monetizable asset. Community features were prioritized behind fiduciary duties. Founders were no longer humble builders; they were pawns in a pump and dump.

This used to be fun, we say, and our tools used to be good. But no longer, because [VCs ruin everything](https://databased.pedramnavid.com/p/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-data#:~:text=is%20dumb%2C%20and-,VCs%20ruin%20everything,-%2C%20and%20this%20company): “The sudden infusion of billions of dollars in capital without due diligence that brought in so many people looking to make a quick buck on whatever the flavour of the day is.” 

It’s a compelling story. Noble protagonists tried to do a noble thing; smooth-talking villains convinced them to play a game that they had [rigged in their favor](https://slate.com/business/2023/08/chamath-palihapitiya-spac-twitter-taunt-investors.html). Everyone sold out, everything got corrupted, and the [platforms we loved got destroyed](https://databased.pedramnavid.com/p/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-data#:~:text=Another%20platform%20I%20once%20loved%20was%20also%20destroyed.).

# Everyone needs money

It also…doesn’t really make sense? It’s not that VCs are Good—far from it. It’s an industry full of entitled, performative, and insecure men[^4] who are desperately trying to prove how smart they are to entitled, performative, and not-yet-insecure 25-year olds.[^5] The problem with the narrative that VC money ruins products is that it has to ruin them through some mechanism. When a wholesome and well-meaning startup deposits $25 million into their bank account, their once-loved product doesn’t immediately become terrible through some sort of divine transubstantiation. The money has to work its way to the product, through the choices the company makes. And not all that clear why a company with a bunch of money would make worse choices than a company without it.

***A brief programming note:** There are two ways in which VC money can affect a startup. One is in how it affects its founders and its people. The second is in how it affects the product it brings to market. This post focuses on the latter question. But the first one is at least as interesting, and will probably be what next week’s post is about. *

Consider dbt Labs, which has become the poster child for this dynamic. It built a beloved product that was supported by legions of adoring fans, of both the software and the company. Its growth started going vertical just as the funding market did, and dbt Labs quickly went from a bootstrapped consultancy to a venture-backed behemoth, with hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank. It was [around then](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dbt-labs-raises-222m-in-series-d-funding-at-4-2b-valuation-led-by-altimeter-with-participation-from-databricks-and-snowflake-301489733.html) that people began [to ask questions](https://databased.pedramnavid.com/p/we-need-to-talk-about-dbt). Within a year, it was open season on dbt Labs, and all the whispers were the same: dbt had lost its original magic. It was no longer an open-source project trying to make people’s lives better; it was a desperate commercial enterprise, trying to convert community and customer love into a sales pipeline. As its sales team grew, its product experience eroded. People were angry, and *righteously* so: They sold out, people said, and justice is served through product criticism and customer churn.

But there’s something very counterintuitive about those complaints. Prior to raising money, dbt was a side project, built in whatever spare time and with whatever leftover money Fishtown Analytics had when they were done paying the bills keeping their consulting business running. The project could only move as fast as that schedule allowed. 

Now, it’s a product funded by $400 million dollars of investment, built by a company that can blow a huge hole in its balance sheet to develop it. Regardless of the sustainability of that model, it’s hard to see how something built by a small team on nights and weekends would be less useful, less complete, and less delightful than one that has dozens of designers and engineers figuring out exactly what people want and building that.

Yes, there are arguments for how this could go wrong. dbt Labs—or any well-funded startup; I don’t specifically care about dbt Labs here; they’re just a useful and well-understood example—could stop building features that people want and start building things that people will pay for, like [integrations with Okta](https://benn.substack.com/p/so-you-want-to-sell-to-the-enterprise#:~:text=tier%20are%20just-,single%20sign%2Don,-and%20priority%20support). They could introduce dark patterns that frustrate users into buying something they don’t want. They could overbuild, building features that make the product marginally easier to sell, but considerably more awkward to use. They could stop talking to the “community,” and prioritize their product roadmap by how deep the pockets are of the people who are asking for stuff. As a venture-backed business, they’re motivated to make money first, and make people happy second.[^6] 

But these incentives apply to companies that are bootstrapped too, and maybe even more so. Companies that haven’t raised venture capital *have* to make money. One bad month and it’s game over. If anyone is motivated to put their own financial needs ahead of their “responsibility” as community stewards, it’s the leaders of a business whose survival depends, pay period to pay period, on those financial needs being met. 

So why do people turn on startups like dbt Labs? My guess is that it’s actually psychological. Prior to raising money, startups seem pure and uncorrupted. People accept their flaws because of that purity—they’re scrappy small businesses trying to make enough money so that they can keep pursuing their passion; they’re underdogs defying the odds to bring people something that might make their lives better. 

Venture capital doesn’t ruin products—it ruins this myth. Venture-backed startups are transparently capitalist enterprises. We're already in an [existential post-capitalist war with the rich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmr8YmwnZ3w), and one of us is going to end up with all the money. It’ll be them, we know it, but people will be damned if they hand over their money so easily now. Well-funded startups have money; why do they need more? 

In other words, product NPS is a feeling that’s defined by what we think about who we’re paying as much as what we’re paying for[^7]—and “the product got worse” is a useful rationalization.

# Growing versus making money

I’m not sure that’s the whole story though. [Earlier this week](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-02/sbf-s-defense-will-be-tough?srnd=undefined), Matt Levine made the case that Elon Musk should take the company formerly known as Twitter public. [From a July issue of ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-07-18/buyout-funds-buy-from-themselves?cmpid=BBD100223_MONEYSTUFF&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=231002&utm_campaign=moneystuff&embedded-checkout=true#footer-ref-footnote-2)*[Money Stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-07-18/buyout-funds-buy-from-themselves?cmpid=BBD100223_MONEYSTUFF&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=231002&utm_campaign=moneystuff&embedded-checkout=true#footer-ref-footnote-2)*: 

> Ed Hammond [wrote in June](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-06-05/for-his-next-trick-elon-musk-should-take-twitter-public) that Musk should just take Twitter public again, and I am increasingly [coming around to that view](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-06-05/elon-musk-had-fun-with-dogecoin?sref=1kJVNqnU), mainly because it would be the funniest possible outcome. The problem for Musk is:
> If Twitter is a private company and you own almost all of the equity, you are mainly exposed to its *cash flows*, not the *meme potential of its stock*. If you take it public and sell a bunch of stock to your ardent fans, the business results matter less, and your ability to attract attention matters more. Surely, given the facts here, that increases the valuation?

Levine’s argument is that shareholders can value their equity in a company in two ways: Based on the profits the company makes and eventually owes them, or based on how much they can sell that equity for to somebody else.

Most small businesses think in terms of the former approach—so much so, in fact, that equity is often an afterthought. People don’t start yoga studios or family law firms or coffee shops for the equity in those businesses; gyms aren’t using Carta to manage their cap table. People start them because they think they can make money by selling their services for more than it costs to provide them. For these businesses, profitability is essential, but *growth* isn’t—so long as they can steadily cover their costs, they can operate indefinitely. 

Startups that raise small amounts of money[^8] can function the same way. If they can pay their expenses with their revenue, they don’t need to expand their product or business beyond what’s necessary to keep customers happy and retained. 

But once a company raises real money, this is no longer true. Because VCs don’t just invest in startups to make money; they invest in startups to make money by *selling their equity for more than they paid for it*. They don’t want the rights to future cash flows; they want to cash out, and make [all their money all at once](https://youtu.be/BzAdXyPYKQo?si=w5OHoB5qElek0hUX&t=51). 

Because of that, it’s not true that bootstrapped startups and startups that have raised meaningful venture capital both want to make money. The former does. The latter wants to grow. A successful business that people love and produces a reasonable profit isn’t good enough. It has to keep finding new customers, new markets, new features, and new upsell plans. There is no cruising altitude for a venture-backed startup. The options are to fly higher, or stall trying.[^9] 

[As Randy Au pointed out](https://counting.substack.com/p/everything-tries-to-become-a-one) earlier this week, *that’s* what ruins products. It encourages companies to push them beyond what they are naturally suited to do. They bolt on unnecessary new features; they build things that only a few people want; they try to colonize adjacent use-cases because that’s what’s required to grow. It makes the product worse, but no board of venture capitalists would approve the alternative—holding steady, leveling off, growing slowly and turning a modest profit.[^10] 

# Suite shop

Randy continues:

> I keep asking myself whether it is possible to avoid the fate of wanting to become an all-in-one product. I had a huge amount of trouble doing so because it just felt so weird and unnatural. 

I think this is right—it *is* unnatural, at least for startups that are under a constant pressure to grow. But could they grow in a different way? Our default assumption is that products grow by gradually expanding like urban [sprawl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuSbELCNloc): Dead features rise like mountains beyond mountains, [and there's no end in sight](https://genius.com/39527). 

It seems, however, like there might be a solution to this: Build more suites. Suppose that a company builds a useful product that does something small well. It’s found its wedge, and has customers happily using it to solve a narrow problem. Instead of expanding that product, could they just build another, adjacent product? 

Most obviously, this would protect the initial product from bloat. The business could grow without forcibly growing the surface area of something that’s already reached its comfortable size. Thinking in suites—or at least, being open to the possibility of building new products rather than always defaulting to expanding the existing one—could also help people draw more natural lines around what a product, or set of products, is meant to do. Features wouldn’t need to be shoehorned into existing workflows.

This would also keep existing products from getting sanded down. The pressure to grow can make specialized products that serve niche customers worse because it encourages vendors to chase bigger, more generic audiences. An all-in-one leviathan has to have wide appeal. A suite of tools can include a [simple product](https://www.rawlings.com/product/P-P120BFL.html) for everyday buyers, and a [breathtakingly beautiful](https://www.ebay.com/itm/185992084071?hash=item2b4dfdfa67:g:gMsAAOSwcJlktWfY) one for suckers power users.

There are real obstacles to this—most notably, people don’t necessarily want suites. For example, I’m not sure where, exactly, a tool that’s desperately [trying not to be a BI tool](https://benn.substack.com/i/136852343/everything-becomes-bi) draws the line around its first product and starts building its second. But today, we give in to pressure to always be growing, as a product and as a business that VCs will happily back. We'd all be better off—and maybe there'd be [fewer reports of our death](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/the-reports-of-my-death-are-greatly-exaggerated)—if we thought about ways to grow the business without always growing the product.

[^8]: To me, a small amount of money is any amount that is low enough that investors never follow up to ask what happened to it. If you raise $1 million from a big angel investor, they’ll never email you to check in or tell you what to do; they just want you to give them more than $1 million dollars at some point in the future. If you raise $100 million from a VC firm, they will want to attend board meetings and get updates and maybe fire you. There’s no exact line for VCs where the former type of involvement becomes the latter, but I’d guess that startups could raise somewhere around three million dollars from professional investors before they start caring about where it went.

[^9]: Raising venture money also affects how companies are allowed to fail. A struggling small business can just shut down. Though they could try to save themselves with a bunch of unsavory growth hacks, they could also decide that they’d rather close with dignity. Struggling venture-backed startups are encouraged to pull out every stop to save their businesses, including ugly product anti-patterns and marketing maneuvers (e.g., everything Twitter has done over the last year).

[^10]: A lot of people have said that data companies’ *valuations* are what are ruining their products. I don’t think that actually matters all that much. Had dbt Labs raised their last round at a $1 billion instead of a $4.2 billion valuation, *growth* would still be the imperative. There is no option to level off for a $1 billion company either.

# Transforming into San Diego

*Are we becoming a pleasant place where nothing happens?*

---

![ ](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FFKE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6481bd81-674b-4fa0-b20f-f4d2e25f3a9d_1598x924.jpeg)

A strange thing happened, during the [opening keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNZLcsHAdco) of the fourth edition of [Coalesce](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/), dbt Labs' annual conference that was held this week in San Diego. For ninety minutes, through stories about the past, present and future of dbt; through several product releases and roadmap announcements; through interviews with customers—through all of that, at a tech conference, about data, in the year 2023, there was never a single mention of AI.

There were no AI-powered features. There were no chatbots; no code-assistants; no promises that [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/documentation) will one day write itself. There were no lofty predictions about how we’re entering a new technological era, and no dire warnings about how companies that ignore this generational wave will be left behind. There weren’t even any jokes about [how AI is all we ever talk about](https://www.captechconsulting.com/blogs/no-limits-on-data-key-takeaways-from-the-2023-snowflake-summit#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20drinking%20game%2C%20every%20time%20I%20say%20AI%2C%20you%20have%20to%20do%20a%20shot.). 

Instead, there was a discussion about process. dbt Labs launched an architectural framework called [dbt Mesh](https://www.getdbt.com/product/dbt-mesh), which is as much an operational best practice as a product update. They rolled out [new capabilities](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/new-dbt-cloud-features-announced-at-coalesce-2023#:~:text=Better%2C%20smarter%20CI/CD%20out%20of%20the%20box) to help data teams standardize their deployment processes. At the end of the keynote, a customer shared a story about how they solved their data governance and reliability problems with a combination of dbt features, organizational updates, and improvements to their collaborative processes.

As an occasional advocate for [boring](https://benn.substack.com/i/51867183/the-boring-industry) [things](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-end-of-our-purple-era),[^1] I’m probably obligated to say that is a good thing. The problems that data teams deal with aren’t likely to be solved by some fancy flourish of AI, or by a wrapper around ChatGPT. They’ll be solved by a bunch of people doing the tough legwork that’s necessary to gradually push us all forward. And the features that dbt Labs released this week are that sort of legwork.[^2] 

People who work in finance periodically joke that a lot other people who work in finance are making bad decisions right now because they’ve never worked in an era of high interest rates. Though [rates](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1aoZc) aren’t *that *high by historical standards, they’re nearly double what anyone with even a decade of experience has seen in their professional lives. A 34-year old trader might know, abstractly, that interest rates could go as high as five percent—or even well higher—but they’ve only read about it in textbooks.[^3] 

There’s arguably a reputational version of this phenomenon in the data industry. For the last [ten](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) [years](https://tdwi.org/articles/2022/02/28/ppm-all-analytics-engineers-have-sexiest-job.aspx), we’ve all been told how important our work is. McKinsey and HBR constantly wrote urgent reports about their weren’t enough of us to satisfy the explosive demand for the skills we had. Our careers had a sense of open-ended potential. We could become the next business leaders, the next CEOs, [the next GMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_DePodesta), next founders of companies that VCs would pour millions of dollars into. If our work was tinged with [drudgery](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html), that’s been ok; our resumes were still sparkling. We were living in New York or San Francisco—it was expensive and cramped, but we were at the center of the world.

It’s been a tough year for that narrative. Our careers, once inevitably important, suddenly seem more expendable. Data teams have been hit by waves of layoffs. The “modern data stack” went from being an essential buzzword to an outdated pariah. Our [main-character strut](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/we-all-have-main-character-energy-now) is turning [into a slump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REiJQrmglBs): At Coalesce, several VCs told me they weren’t very excited about any of the early-stage data startups that they’d met recently. The big opportunities are elsewhere, they said.[^4] San Diego was fitting: Data was moving to periphery.

Though [we talk a lot](https://benn.substack.com/p/category-collapse) about what might happen when the world’s money moves on from our industry, we don’t often reckon with what might happen when the world’s attention moves on as well. As I was sitting in the audience at Coalesce, listening to the necessary-but-dull things that need to be done, a thought occurred to me that I had previously missed: Do I actually want to *do* any of those things?[^5] To what extent am I here because of the day-to-day work, and to what extent am I here, working in that darkness, because I believe that it will one day [put me in the light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsovD9IlT3U)? And what happens if the promise of that light drifts away?

The hotel convention center in which Coalesce was held apparently does good business. Over the course of the past week, an [association of police chiefs](https://www.theiacp.org/) came and went; yesterday, the hotel lobby was being redecorated with banners from the [American Society of Emergency Radiology](https://aser.org/annual-meeting-information/); [thousands of fundraising professionals](https://conference.afponline.org/) are on their way this weekend.[^6] 

I found a few pages of notes from some prior event in a lectern in one of the conference rooms. The document—a “Summary of the eCOA Signature Discussion”—opened with four bullets:

You could reasonably argue that the data industry maturing into something more rigorous is a good thing. You could reasonably argue that we need rules, regulations, and [our own form of GAAP standards](https://benn.substack.com/i/137070616/die-a-hero-or-live-long-enough-to-become-an-accountant).[^7] You could reasonably argue that the hype and gold rush of the last decade has attracted [opportunists](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benn-stancil/) and [attention-seekers](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3A%40bennstancil%20friday%20fight&src=typeahead_click) who aren’t here for the right reasons, and it’s well past time to [take away the punch bowl](https://www.stlouisfed.org/education/removing-the-punch-bowl-inflation-and-contractionary-monetary-policy). You could reasonably argue that it’s time for us to become professionals, like everyone else.

But if that’s where we end up, I hope that this document—this calcified fossil; this real-life [TPS report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy3rjQGc6lA); this dire warning about the worst thing that can happen: A box on a compliance form is checked in the wrong order—is not indicative of who we have to become, and how we have to talk about what we do. 

As we all left Coalesce this year, the prevailing whispers in the hallway were that it was gradually becoming less of a community meetup, and more of a corporate marketing event. There were fewer practitioners and more vendors, people said. There were fewer product releases for open-source enthusiasts, and more for large enterprise buyers. There were fewer technical talks and more sponsored infomercials.[^8] Nearly everyone I talked to said that, while they’d be back next year, they hoped that there would be more practitioners, more technical content, and more community events. 

Bluntly, I hope that dbt Labs doesn’t listen to closely too that feedback*.* To me, Coalesce has never been about the content; not *really.* There are other meetups that are less corporate; there have always been other conferences that are more technical; there are other vendors and products that are exist exclusively for the practitioners in the trenches.

Coalesce has been singularly unique for a different reason—it was an unabashed celebration of its attendees. The content of the conference was simply a vehicle: It was a lens through which people could see themselves in one another; it was an excuse for all of us to brag a little about the obscure or mundane accomplishments that nobody else would understand; it was a way to create a [cheering section](https://benn.substack.com/p/delirium#:~:text=Every%20talk%20inspires%20a%20tidal%20wave%20of%20excitement%2C%20encouragement%2C%20and%20general%20good%20cheer.). People may have come to Coalesce for tips and technical tricks, but they left with [moments](https://heathbrothers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The-Power-of-Moments-Chapter-1.pdf)—moments of connection, elevation, and pride, created by people who refused to be quiet in their appreciation of one another.[^9] 

Technical content alone can’t create these moments. I’m guessing that the eCOA signature discussion was a useful conversation, full of valuable tips and actionable takeaways—and I’m also guessing that nobody left that session *feeling* anything. 

I don’t know if Coalesce was intentionally engineered to be different, or if it simply [evolved that way](https://benn.substack.com/p/all-in-one-place#:~:text=Talk%20emcees%20made,follow%20the%20beat.), because of its origins on Slack and as a virtual event. But as data becomes less of a fad and more of a profession; as our work becomes less lofty and more legwork; and as data recedes from being a main character and becomes a supporting part, I hope that future versions of Coalesce make explicit efforts to create as many moments for as many people as past versions have.[^10] Because nice as they are, parties, and advice, and a bunch of LinkedIn connections aren’t *that* special—what’s special is giving people who are increasingly working in the dark their [moment in the light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrJDpJqtm0s). 

# An update from last week

After the [post](https://benn.substack.com/p/there-is-no-post-today) last week, a number of people reached out to me with stories to share about the war in Israel and Gaza. Though my intention was to include them in this week’s post, my obligations for Coalesce ended up taking more time than I thought they would. I still plan on sharing those stories (pending folks’ permission), and sadly, it looks like they’ll be just as relevant next week and in the weeks after as they were two weeks ago.  

So, to those of you who sent me messages, thank you. And if I haven’t gotten back to you yet, I will.

[^1]: And for [The Process](https://benn.substack.com/i/102099843/trust-the-process), and for [products that make processes better](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-product-is-the-process).

[^2]: Will they work? I have no idea. But they’re much more likely to work than a flashy dbt chatbot that serves no purpose other than to be marketable as dbt AI.

[^3]: “Do you think you know what it's like to be Paul Volker because you [read about him in a book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GY3sO47YYo)?”

[^4]: [Yesterday, we felt like dancing; today, we’ll watch the world pass on by.](https://genius.com/Griff-into-the-walls-lyrics) (But seriously, why are you reading this post, *vert1go vol. 1 *came out like six hours ago, get out of here and [go listen to it](https://open.spotify.com/album/1RcfzHK44GEHSBwAH1NQeY?si=FJT8OdbeTGed5hH81CSfTQ).)

[^5]: Hahaha no, nobody lets me do any of these things anymore. But do I want to write a blog about organizational architectures for designing durable data governance frameworks? Do *you* want to *read* a blog about organizational architectures for designing durable data governance frameworks?

[^6]: A cop, an analytics engineer, an emergency radiologist, and a fundraising professional walk into a hotel bar…and they’re all a joke, because they’re all still wearing lanyards and corporate backpacks.

[^7]: Is “GAAP standards” like “ATM machine?”

[^8]: These things may or may not actually be true. It’s possible that this edition of Coalesce had more community talks than any other, or the highest ratio of practitioners to sponsors. But, for better or for worse, how people feel about these things matters more than what is actually true.

[^9]: You could argue that this is actually bad, and that it oversold an industry that was bound to come back to earth. Which, ok, but, whatever. My point here is that being celebrated is a rare and powerful thing. People can come to their conclusions as to whether or not what data people do is worth celebrating (though if it’s not, the solution is rather obviously not to do the thing at all, not to not celebrate it).

[^10]: The good news is that I don’t think that the [predictable and understandable evolution](https://benn.substack.com/p/all-in-one-place#:~:text=As%20they%20add%20more%20enterprise%20clients%2C%20community%2Dled%20product%20development%20will%20give%20way%20to%20dollar%2Ddriven%20roadmaps%20and%20exclusive%20advisory%20boards) of Coalesce—”as they add more enterprise clients, community-led product development will give way to dollar-driven roadmaps and exclusive advisory boards”—is incompatible with this.

From [Bader Mansour](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bader-mansour-098b414), the owner of [NAZDAQ](https://www.nazdaq-it.com/), a data services and solutions company in Nazareth, the largest Arab city in Israel:

> I am located in the ancient city of Nazareth, the hometown of Jesus. I am Israeli and Palestinian at the same time. Twenty percent of Israel’s population are Palestinian Arabs who are also Israeli citizens. I studied at Israeli universities and worked in the Israel hi-tech scene and also had two years of consulting in the Silicon Valley and Boston in the mid-nineties. When I returned to Israel in 1997, I established [NAZDAQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asY6RbU3xUc) (Nazareth Data Quest) in Nazareth, so my people, the Palestinian Arabs, can also join the tech field, like the rest of the Israelis.
> Both Israelis and Palestinians are crushed right now. It is very sad here. My heart goes out for people suffering from both sides and praying for peace.

From a director at dbt Labs:

> My partner is half-Israeli. My partner’s three first cousins were all drafted last week as part of the IDF, leaving thirteen kids in total behind. We think they are safe, as they are in the reserves and not on the front line. But it's terrifying for everyone, nonetheless. There are no winners in war. 
> And regardless of which side you support, the rise in hate towards Jews and Arabs is unacceptable. I have always felt relatively safe being an American Jew. I no longer feel that way.

From the founder of an AI startup:

> I grew up in Lebanon, and was a refugee in 2006 during the Israel-Hezbollah war. Business as usual is difficult when I'm this distracted. I am optimistic that Israel won't want to open a second front with Lebanon, but either way, the horror of war is distracting. 

From [Maayan Salom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maayansa), the cofounder of [Elementary Data](https://www.elementary-data.com/), a data observability startup based in Tel Aviv:

> I grew up in a Kibbutz three miles from Gaza. My family is safe, thank god, but [I lost many friends](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maayansa_in-the-last-3-days-a-lot-of-you-have-asked-activity-7117197683533971456-kDXA) this Saturday.
> Despite that, I don't really care about people all over the world that don't “stand with Israel.” That's fine. It's a complicated, bloody, and sad conflict. I don't have an opinion about most conflicts in the world. It's ok that people don't care.
> What truly makes me feel desperate and hopeless is the amount of people around the world that are celebrating what happened to us. They are happy about this. It makes me feel angry, sad, and mostly scared. I think I will never feel safe again, not in Israel, and definitely nowhere else in the world. 

From [Shiri Friedman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shirifriedman/), the head of demand generation at [Hex](https://hex.tech/):

> I'm an American Jew, and I've been a mess all week. Seeing business-as-usual continue, especially in the tech space (which has been so monumentally infused with and impacted by Israelis) is painful. The silence has been deafening. 

From the founder of a data observability startup in Israel:

> As an Israeli millennial, October 7th will be a watershed moment where many of the things we held true regarding life here have changed. I wanted to provide a bit of data about what life has been like since then, and want to share it in memory of all those who lost their lives in this war.
> Although the exact numbers aren’t yet known, around 1,400 Israelis died in the terror attack, most of them civilians, and more than 200 people were kidnapped. This is more than the total number of Israeli deaths from wars in the last fifty years. Given the size of the Israeli population, it's roughly equivalent to around 50,000 American deaths, nearly sixteen times the size of 9/11, and 7,800 American hostages, more than five times the number of POWs in the Vietnam war. Nearly everyone in Israel has some connection to someone who was killed or kidnapped. 
> Israel has also been under constant fire of rockets. More than 7,500 rockets have been fired since the start of the war; for some villages, that's an average of ten rockets an hour. Some people living close to Gaza stay in their shelters for most of the day, fearing they won't be able to reach it in time.
> Besides the three years of mandatory service in Israel, all citizens have to serve in reserve military units until about the age of forty. Israel has called for 300,000 reserve soldiers, about 0.3 percent of the entire population, and ten percent of the relevant age group. Nearly everyone I know is either serving or has a direct family member serving now. 
> The financial cost of the war has been estimated to be around 1 billion NIS (or $250 million) each day. Businesses have been forced to close down because they either don’t have staff or customers. Tourism in Israel has come to a complete standstill; nearly all international airlines are canceling their flights. 
> Personally, I'm currently working on a data observability startup. Both my co-founder and I were called back to service on the first day of the war. Like us, many startups have seen most of their workforce called or volunteer for service. The support we are getting from colleagues and friends around the world has been amazing and heartwarming. Although these are difficult times, I am sure that better times are coming.

From an machine learning lead at a gaming company based in Tel Aviv:[^1]

> We're used to missile sirens here. Every building has a bomb shelter, and lots of apartments have safety rooms. That's part of what you look for when you move: What's it like in the shelter? Is it well decorated? Would it be comfortable to spend a long time there?
> But the last few days have been different. There are sirens a few times a day. My wife, my baby, and I are in and out of the shelter all day. I just wish it would stop—I wish the missiles would stop.
> I know the conflict is complicated, but some things aren't. It’s not complicated to not kill kids. Still, everyone knows someone who was killed last weekend. A teammate's parents were on one of the beaches that were attacked. They've been missing ever since. Nobody can find them. They were probably killed, but we don't know. 
> Are we safe now? I don't know that either.

From [Noy Twerski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noy-twerski), the cofounder and CEO of [Sherloq](https://www.sherloqdata.io/), a data and AI startup that graduated from YCombinator earlier this year:

> I now live in Tel Aviv, Israel. As founders, all we want to do is build a product that gives value to our users, solve real-life problem, sell it to customers, and iterate.
> What we don't want to be doing, but found ourselves doing in the past week—deal with war, innocent people from both sides that are suffering, running to a shelter room (while writing this email) because of missile sirens, and having many people on our team drafted to reserve duty.
> But even worse—each one of us knew someone who was greatly affected by the recent Hamas terror attack, and that alone is very difficult to deal with.
> Startup life is hard enough.

From an digital marketer and entrepreneur who founded a startup that builds infrastructure to support remote work in Gaza tech industry:

> Leaving Gaza for Europe to do a master's degree just a month before the brutal war was like a short break from the constant chaos of life as a Palestinian. But chaos is still chasing me even when I came out of Gaza. It is like you can not live inside and you can not have peace of mind outside. 
> Recent days have been very overwhelming to me. Losing two close cousins, and being cut off from my family for nine days was a never-ending nightmare. I clung to hope for that one notification, a message confirming they were alive. I connected with them yesterday for a forty-second call, and hearing my mom's tearful voice was bittersweet. It meant she was alive but in anguish. 
> For seven years, Rozzah was my cherished companion cat, a beloved member of our family. She later became a mother to six adorable kittens. Amid the relentless war, I lost her and her six kittens in this war.
> Losing our home, built through a loan, is a heart-wrenching pain. The war turned it into rubble, leaving my dad with nine years of debt, and our dreams in ruins. This sorrow serves as a constant reminder of the war's injustice and hardship. 
> I'm overwhelmed by a deep sadness, unable to protect loved ones, witnessing my homeland in ruins. This is a grief that can't be expressed.

Yesterday morning, a seven-year old boy [was killed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/nyregion/nypd-tow-truck-boy-killed.html) by a police tow truck a few blocks from my apartment. I learned about it a couple hours after it happened, from a news alert from the *New York Times*. 

I can see the trees that surround the intersection where he died from my apartment window. It was hard to look at them yesterday, knowing the awful grief that was hidden beneath their leaves.

In Israel and Gaza, there are thousands of such intersections. There are too many to report on; no push notifications go out when children die. They are simply lost, burned, shot, buried in rubble, sometimes with their brothers and sisters and parents, and sometimes alone. 

The pain must be incomprehensible. I don’t know how anybody looks at any of the trees there, knowing the things that they must’ve seen. 

There are ways to help, if you want to.

—

You can give money. The Gazan marketer and founder started a campaign to rebuild her family’s home. Eleven people, including a week-old newborn boy, need shelter, and no longer have anywhere to go. If you’d like to help them, [email me](https://benn.substack.com/about#:~:text=I%20can%20be%20emailed%20at%20at%20benn.electronicmail(%40gmail.com).), and I can send you the page where you can give. If ten percent of the people who get this email donate twenty dollars, she’ll reach her goal.  

From a data product manager at an HR tech company:

> I'm a former resident of one of the kibbutzim hit, an IDF veteran, and current reservist lucky to not yet be called as I live in New York. While anxiously waiting to be called, I’m fundraising to help rebuild my home after the terrorist attack. If [people could donate](https://thechesedfund.com/garineinhashlosha/kibbutz-ein-hashlosha), it would be a massive help. 

—

You can reach out to people, and tell them you see what’s happening. Don’t look away, several people told me. Don’t pretend that nothing is happening. Yes, it is a confusing and complicated tragedy—but most of all, it is a tragedy. From one email:

> Just acknowledging that *something horrible* has happened (and is happening) is actually really, really important.

That’s part of what’s been tough, someone else said. From another:

> My social media is filled with Jewish people speaking up against the heinous acts but others are silent.

And another, from a Palestinian living in Israel:

> Friends that show empathy are needed at this time where my feed is so polarized between my Jewish friends and my Arab friends.

—

You can work with their businesses. From Noy, the CEO of Sherloq:

> Sherloq is ChatGPT and Co-pilot for your internal DB. Our product is a plug-in that sits on top of any query editor, so we easily integrate into our users' workflow.
> We're starting with data teams and people who know SQL inside organizations. From our own experience, we understand data and SQL aren't deterministic; a simple text-to-SQL just doesn't do the trick. So there's a conversation, and validation process that creates better prompts and better answers in each session. That's why our chatbot is kind of like the "smol analyst" approach [that you described](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-smol-analyst). 
> We know how to give the most value to companies with 500 to 2,500 employees that usually have established a data team of at least five, so we're looking to meet more data execs, and more specifically VPs, directors of data analytics, data science, and data engineering teams in enterprise companies.
> I personally believe that the common Hebrew phrase, “in their death, they honored us with life,” is now, more than ever, extremely relevant. With all the recent events, we continue to operate as usual and in full power, building and providing our existing and new customers with a product that they love, just as we have been doing until now.

From Bader, the owner of NAZDAQ:

> NAZDAQ's flagship product is [B2Win Suite](http://www.b2winsuite.com), a platform designed to combine the essential functionalities of various data-related software, including data integration, data analytics, BI, reporting, and output management. We have more than sixty customers using this platform, including some Fortune 1000 companies. We have a native integration with Infor LN ERP (Previously Baan) and our customers come from this group.
> Our new application, [B2Data](https://www.b2winsuite.com/b2data/) is a platform to simplify and streamline the processing of business data to allow companies to fetch data from multiple data sources, prepare, cleanse, and transform it to create insightful data presentation using the strength of Excel, or feed BI systems or other systems for further use. B2Data is based on a modular workflow-architecture, business users can intuitively create data scenarios with almost no programming needed to be run on-demand or fully automated.
> Our integration with Excel is very unique. Unlike Microsoft tools, we create Excel files in jobs and merge data into existing Excel templates to automatically create simple yet powerful Excel sheets with Pivot tables and graphs.
> Our product can work on a private cloud or on-premises and we are exploring customers with other business systems.  

From [Philippe Boutros](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippeboutros/), the CEO of [GetWhys](https://getwhys.io/), who moved from Lebanon to the United States for college:

> We have a product that combines LLMs with our own proprietary dataset to help companies find, decide on, and buy software faster, cheaper, and with fewer headaches. Companies like NoFraud and Tableau are already benefiting from it, and we have a waitlist longer than we can service. We’re raising money right now—if you’re a VC who invests in seed-stage B2B SaaS companies, we’d love to show you what we’ve built.
> I hope the violence ends immediately rather than spreads, so we can focus on building a better world, rather than destroying it.

From an Israeli marketing executive who mentors women who work in tech in Gaza: “Not enough people know about Gaza’s tech industry.” Programs like Gaza Sky Geeks have trained thousands of engineers. [Today](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/14/palestine-tech-industry-hamas-israel-war/), their “offices are destroyed, the fiber lines are destroyed. The universities are destroyed.” Nobody in Gaza knows if it can be rebuilt.

If you’d like to learn more about [Sherloq](https://www.sherloqdata.io/contact-us), [NAZDAQ](https://www.nazdaq-it.com/contact/), [GetWhys](mailto:philippe@getwhys.io), or [Gaza Sky Geeks](https://gazaskygeeks.com/donate/), reach out to them. Give them to fifteen minutes to show you what they’ve spent years building.

# Why are we still surprised that startups are hard?

*We think they can be hacked, but the only enduring moat is effort.*

---

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AEk7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F182df358-15d5-4a8f-a878-b5b56226b64d_1600x1151.png)
*[This time won’t be so bad.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBwOLUcdCEg)*

I have some follow up questions for Jensen Huang. 

Huang, who is sixty, is the founder and CEO of Nvidia, one of five U.S. companies currently worth more than a trillion dollars. A couple weeks ago, [in an interview](https://twitter.com/gilbert/status/1715022995541066163) on the *Acquired* podcast, Huang was asked what company he’d start today if he were thirty again. Without hesitation, he said he wouldn’t start one. The work he put into Nvidia—which, given his net worth of $36 billion, has netted him more than a billion dollars a year, three million dollars a day, or $130,000 an hour—wasn’t worth it:

> The reason why I wouldn't do it, and it goes back to why it's so hard, is building a company and building Nvidia turned out to have been a million times harder than I expected it to be—any of us expected it to be. And at that time, if we realized the pain and suffering, and just how vulnerable you're going to feel, and the challenges that you're going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame, and the list of all the things that go wrong, I don't think anyone would start a company. Nobody in their right mind would do it. 
> That's kind of the superpower of an entrepreneur. They don't know how hard it is, and they only ask themselves, "How hard can it be?"...
> You have to get yourself to believe that it's not that hard, because it's way harder than you think. And so, if I go taking all of my knowledge now and I go back, and I said, I'm going to endure that whole journey again? I think it's too much. It is just too much.

The follow ups I wish they’d asked: Is this a statement about how hard it is to build a company, or about the actual utility—or lack thereof, I suppose—of being extraordinarily rich and relatively famous?[^1] If Nvidia wasn’t personally worth it, was the work worth it, in a kind of self-sacrificial way, for the greater good?[^2] And most of all, why was it such a surprise that building Nvidia would be so hard?

Though I can’t relate to a man worth more than [Delta Airlines](https://www.google.com/search?q=delta+ticker) in very many ways, I can at least sympathize with that last point, because I’ve often asked myself the same thing. Starting a company—even [one that’s worth](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/26/thoughtspot-acquires-mode-analytics-a-bi-platform-for-200m-in-cash-and-stock/) 0.02 percent of Nvidia’s current market cap—was a lot harder than I ever expected it to be. And our experience seems to be the rule rather than exceptions, because nearly every founder you talk to says the same thing: “This is so much harder than I thought it would be.”

Which is…weird? Everyone is told startups are hard—the hardest thing you’ll ever do. We’re told that we think we understand, but we don’t; that whatever we think, it’s harder than that. Given how pervasive that message is—including from the guy who won the lottery we’re all playing[^3]—why are we still consistently surprised by how hard it actually is? 

Contrast Huang’s comments with every post-game interview or Hall of Fame speech from a professional athlete, who’s probably sacrificed more than your average startup founder. They always talk about the work; about putting in endless hours in the gym; about struggles and overcoming adversity and blood and sweat and tears. But in decades of watching athletes reflect on the long climb from their neighborhood gym or Little League field to becoming a world champion, I’ve never once heard one of them say that they were surprised by how hard it was. The injuries were part of the game; the setbacks were what they trained for; the losing seasons were part of the [process](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2729018-the-definitive-history-of-trust-the-process). Nobody’s surprised by the suffering, because the suffering is what made them great.[^4] 

So why was Huang surprised? Why was I surprised? Was we delicate? Delusional? Surprises aren’t supposed to be surprising when you’re told over and over it’s coming. [And yet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBwOLUcdCEg)

# Work, for better or for worse

When you tell people you’re starting a company, they will ask you what it does. If the conversation is with a venture capitalist, it will usually go like this:

> **Investor:** So what does getai.tech[^5] do?
> **You:** It’s like *[ some other popular company that you hope that they wish they’d invested in ]* but *[ different in what you believe is some clever way ]*.
> **Investor:** Couldn’t *[ that popular company that they did invest in, but in their Series E in 2021, and are now just praying to get their money back ]* build that? 
> **You:** They could but they won’t, because *[ what you think is another clever-sounding point about market dynamics, and innovators’ dilemmas, and being “[the latest megatrend]-native” ]*.
> **Investor:** Interesting, that does sound clever. *[ Emails their now-teetering Series E portfolio company to ask them if they’ve ever considered adding [a clever-sounding but useless feature that nobody would ever want unless they just wanted to be a part of the latest fad]. The company’s CEO says thank you, that they’ll look into it, and then forwards the email to their trash can. ]*
> **You:** Yes, we’re excited about it. 
> **Investor:** It is a very exciting time.

If you have this conversation enough, you’ll stop looking at the popular company that’s been around for a decade for what it *is*—mostly years and years of very hard work—and start seeing it for what it *isn’t—*a missing piece; a single blemish; [one fatal architectural flaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0vFP_jXN4&t=387). Moreover, people will start getting excited about your company because you have that missing piece. They won’t ask you about all the stuff you have to copy to build a great email client, or a new CRM, or the next enduring social network; they’ll ask you about your clever wedge. Tell someone about your cloud-first Alteryx, or your warehouse-native HubSpot, or your dbt-backed Tableau, or your AI-enabled Zendesk, and they’ll want to talk about the cloud-first, warehouse-native, dbt-backed, and AI-enabled parts. And we’ll deceive ourselves into believing those are the important parts. But all the work is in the Alteryx, HubSpot, Tableau, and Zendesk parts.

Because big businesses aren’t built on gimmicks. You can blitz your way through Sand Hill Road on them, and spike up the app store charts on them, but you can’t actually replace [Gmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailbox_(application)), or [Salesforce](https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/11/salesforce-buys-big-data-startup-relateiq-for-up-to-390m/), or [Instagram](https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/the-debut-of-beme-a-social-app-that-aims-for-authenticity/), or [Instagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispo), or [Instagram](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/13/style/bereal-app.html), or [Instagram](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/style/lapse-photo-app.html), with them. Even the seemingly-instant successes can’t become lasting companies without putting in the work—work developing checkbox features, building [enterprise sales motions](https://benn.substack.com/p/so-you-want-to-sell-to-the-enterprise), creating support escalation policies, arguing about sales compensation strategies, defining career ladders, preparing for board meetings, negotiating office leases, hiring lawyers, changing lawyers, dealing with Trinet, helping employees deal with Trinet, responding to investor emails about clever-sounding but useless features that nobody would ever want unless they just wanted to be a part of the latest fad, setting up the office wifi, fixing the office wifi, yelling at Comcast Business about the office wifi, emailing customers about your new pricing model, redoing your all-hands format, introducing OKRs, again, and a list of a hundred other mundane things that we and everyone else entirely overlooks in their pitch decks. And after we got to about a hundred employees, there was a new list.

In other words, building companies and products are, to borrow [Jeff Bezos’ famous analogy](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312518121161/d456916dex991.htm#:~:text=Most%20people%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9Cthink%20that%20if%20they%20work%20hard%2C%20they%20should%20be%20able%20to%20master%20a%20handstand%20in%20about%20two%20weeks.%20The%20reality%20is%20that%20it%20takes%20about%20six%20months%20of%20daily%20practice.%20If%20you%20think%20you%20should%20be%20able%20to%20do%20it%20in%20two%20weeks%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20just%20going%20to%20end%20up%20quitting.), like learning how to do a handstand. Most people “think that if they work hard, they should be able to master a handstand in about two weeks.” We get excited about our smart idea; we race it to market; we expect the cavalry to arrive and make this easier. But the reality is that doing a handstand “takes about six months of daily practice. If you think you should be able to do it in two weeks, you’re just going to end up quitting”—or, it seems, end up surprised by how hard you have to work.[^6] 

The downside of this is that we can’t hack your way to startup success. We can hack your way into getting attention, or term sheets, or even a few years of vertical revenue growth. But we can’t outrun the work; not forever. Eventually—as the company grows, as the market figures out our hacks, as more people copy what we’ve done—the work we’ve put in becomes our only competitive advantage. We can’t outwit it any more than an athlete can outwit their training. The only true shortcuts are [lots of steroids](https://the-cauldron.com/the-five-wackiest-power-surges-of-the-steroid-era-2693b1beeab7) or [lots of crimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/technology/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-trial-ftx.html).[^7] 

I’d argue that this isn’t just true for companies; it’s also true for products. [We](https://benn.substack.com/i/136852343/everything-becomes-bi) [talk](https://benn.substack.com/p/we-dont-need-another-sql-chatbot#%C2%A7twenty-pages-of-context-in-a-ten-page-window) [a](https://benn.substack.com/p/bi-by-another-name) [lot](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-intergalatic-data-stack) around here about how there’s no silver bullet in BI. Lots of us have looked for one; there’s a new startup every week a new one says they’re going to replace PowerBI or Tableau because what we think is a clever-sounding point about market dynamics, and innovators’ dilemmas, and being “[the latest megatrend]-native.” But we’ve all found out that these companies’ durable advantage isn’t that they once had a good idea; it’s that they’ve built hundreds of obvious features around a couple clever ones.

# Go in the front door

The *upside *of all of this, however, is that we don’t actually need a clever idea to build a great company. When people ask us how getai.tech plans on beating Mailchimp, it’s tempting to say how we’ll start with a freemium product in some vertical they’re missing, build a community of enthusiasts, use data from those users to collect training data for our proprietary LLM, and so on. We’ll win by outflanking and outsmarting the competition. We can’t take them on directly, because they have such a big head start. 

In hindsight, I think that’s a mistake in two ways. First, we can’t actually avoid taking them on directly. The clever plan doesn’t remove the need to compete head on; it just distracts us from it. And second, a lot of companies’ head starts aren’t actually that big. Handstands don’t take two weeks to learn, but they don’t take a lifetime either. Over years of work, companies will have spent a lot of time running in the wrong direction. There will be quirks and rough edges that come with [constantly building new product additions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Mystery_House).[^8] 

The better answer for how we’ll beat Mailchimp, then, is that we’ll line up with them, toe to toe, and build a better product and business. We’ll make Mailchimp, but faster; but better designed; but with more dedicated and relentless customer support. We’ll make Mailchimp without the rust.[^9]

I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the companies that have a reputation for building the best products of this generation—places like Slack, Figma, Superhuman, Notion, and Linear—are basically new versions of a successful predecessor. These companies didn’t distract themselves with four-step strategic maneuvers or clever wedges into a new category that they claimed to be creating. They instead took on the challenge directly—build a better Hipchat, or Illustrator, or Gmail, or Google Docs, or Asana. They knew they’d have to do it eventually, and rather than pretend that they could avoid it, they started with that plan. The strategy was to do the work.[^10] 

Which all startups have to do eventually. The only question is if we’ll be surprised by it.

[^6]: There’s another, less generous reason why [some people](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benn-stancil/) are surprised: We’re used to being successful. We got good grades, or went to good colleges, or were told we were a high performer in another job. We did everything right so far; in a just and just world, shouldn’t our company be a winner too? But that’s not how startups work. The market doesn’t care about how hard you worked before (or didn’t), or if you were successful (or weren’t). The market will erase that history. It gives you no credit (or blame) for it (or the lack of it). For people who are used to being respected for their resumes—and especially for repeat or celebrity founders who’ve logged a lot of hours or done something notable, and feel like they should be rewarded for that—that can be a devastating adjustment.

[^7]: I’d argue that FTX is actually a really good example of how you can’t escape the work. My general sense of the whole situation—not that I’ve been mainlining a half-dozen daily updates about the trial or anything—is that FTX was an extremely lucrative business as a standalone exchange, Alameda was an extremely bad business that made lots of terrible trades, and SBF was a guy who was extremely uninterested in building anything resembling a proper company. So he blew up all three, by, one, committing lots of crimes, and two—and maybe more importantly, because I think it’s a big part of why he committed all the crimes—by not making any effort whatsoever to build the business around the very good exchange that would’ve protected it from the very bad hedge fund. It was all exciting hacks, and no boring work. And fraud. There were also seven counts of fraud.

[^8]: I’m skeptical of a lot of today’s hot AI companies for this reason. It’s not that they’re bad companies; it’s that nearly all of these companies’ competitive advantage is that they have something like a year-long head start over companies being started today. That gap can be closed pretty quickly, especially when the market landscape is constantly shifting and everyone may be running in the wrong direction.

[^9]: Mailchimp is just illustrative here; I have no idea if Mailchimp is good, bad, crusty, musty, dusty, or rusty.

[^10]: Importantly, this is different than some rise-and-grind hustle culture cult. If a startup forces its employees to work 16-hour days building some supposedly differentiating hack, they’ll lose; if a startup asks its employees to work 8-hour days polishing core interfaces and providing great customer service and doing the boring things that lots of other people try to shortcut with supposedly differentiating hacks, they’ll win.

# AI is coming for your favorite product's good user experience

*And BI is still coming for everything, except Excel.*

*[Squirrel!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faa2dHJNFqQ)*

If you’re the CEO of a public company, Wall Street is probably going to [ask you questions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/ai-scores-as-hot-topic-on-earnings-calls-as-interest-deepens) about how you plan to use AI to make your business better. There are a couple ways you can answer those questions: 

Most CEOs, it seems, [are choosing option 2](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/11/ceos-are-investing-in-ai-says-survey-use-it-to-get-a-lucrative-job.html#:~:text=top%20investing%20priority). For example, in just the last three months, PwC built [ChatPwC](https://erp.today/pwc-joins-the-ai-trend-with-its-own-chatpwc/) to help its employees research “common tax questions and regulations.” Walmart launched a tool called [My Assistant](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/empowering-associates-creating-better-work-through-new-donna-morris%3FtrackingId=hAeqMlV7TaKr0rUxVIwjCQ%253D%253D/?trackingId=hAeqMlV7TaKr0rUxVIwjCQ%3D%3D) to “change how our associates work and solve problems.” McKinsey rolled out [Lilli](https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/meet-lilli-our-generative-ai-tool), a “platform that provides a streamlined, impartial search and synthesis of the firm’s vast stores of knowledge to bring our best insights, quickly and efficiently, to clients.” And EY is [investing $1.4 billion](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2023/09/ey-announces-launch-of-artificial-intelligence-platform-ey-ai-following-us-1-4b-investment) in EY.ai.[^1]

Software companies are building similar things in their products. [Zoom AI Companion](https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-ai-companion/) will chat with you about the meeting that you’re in, and tell you what you missed if you joined late. [Intercom Fin](https://www.intercom.com/drlp/ai-chatbot) will answer half of your customer support questions on its own. Notion is [full of chatbots](https://www.notion.so/product/ai)—it will take notes for you, write summaries of your notes, and edit them to be friendlier or more professional. [Atlassian Intelligence](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/unleashing-power-of-ai) lets you interact with Jira tickets via chat. [Generative AI in Slack](https://slack.com/blog/news/introducing-slack-gpt) will…bring the power of generative AI in Slack to help you work smarter, learn faster, and communicate better?[^2] And inside of data companies, we all now have SQL-writing chatbots—[Snowflake Copilot](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/use-ai-snowflake-cortex/), [Databricks Assistant](https://www.databricks.com/blog/whats-new-databricks-sql), [Atlan AI](https://atlan.com/ai), [Hex Magic](https://hex.tech/product/magic-ai/), [ThoughtSpot Sage](https://www.thoughtspot.com/product/sage), [Equals AI Assist](https://equals.com/ai/). 

I have no idea how hard it is to create a bot [that can](https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/meet-lilli-our-generative-ai-tool#:~:text=can%20scan%20our%20entire%20landscape%20of%20knowledge%2C%20identify%20between%20five%20to%20seven%20of%20most%20relevant%20pieces%20of%20content%2C%20summarize%20key%20points%2C%20include%20links%2C%20and%20even%20identify%20experts%20in%20the%20appropriate%20fields.) scan McKinsey’s “entire landscape of knowledge, identify between five to seven of most relevant pieces of content, summarize key points, include links, and even identify experts in the appropriate fields,” or one [that can](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/unleashing-power-of-ai#:~:text=Resolve%20help%20requests%20instantly%20based%20on%20its%20understanding%20of%20knowledge%20base%20articles.%20If%20needed%2C%20it%20can%20also%20ask%20follow%2Dup%20questions%20to%20take%20any%20necessary%20actions.) monitor incoming Jira tickets and “resolve help requests instantly based on its understanding of knowledge base articles,” including asking “follow-up questions to take any necessary actions.” But I do have some sense of how hard it is to build a SQL-writing bot. And the answer is very hard. 

There are challenges that everyone already points out: When I ask “How many accounts did we have in Europe last quarter?,” the bot has to determine what I mean by accounts, where exactly Europe is, and if I’m referring to a fiscal quarter or calendar quarter. It has to know what our fiscal quarter is. It has to know that engineers typically use the term account to refer to a team workspace in a SaaS product, and sales reps typically use the term account to refer to a business that they’re selling to. It has to guarantee, despite LLMs being probabilistic, that when it generates a second query based on my follow-up question, “Of those accounts, which ones were new?,” it builds on the exact same logic that it used in the prior question. It has to make a bunch of assumptions about what “new” means. It has to do all of this on messy data, often spread across thousands of constantly-changing tables that are undocumented, poorly named, and full of ambiguous and seemingly duplicative columns. And it has to know when it doesn’t know the answer, and not [confidently grandstand unhinged nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Ramaswamy).

None of this is impossible, but it takes a lot of time and effort—and a lot of work that goes beyond tuning the AI model itself. You have to build and maintain integrations into metadata repositories; you’ve got to build infrastructure for storing that metadata and evaluating its usefulness; you’ve got to build systems for evaluating the accuracy of results; you have to test hundreds of versions of different prompts;[^3] you have to build feedback loops to help models improve. And you have to let it all run, in the wild, for a long time, to collect and slowly stamp out the thousands of edge cases that no amount of pre-launch testing will ever uncover. It’s [all handstands again](https://benn.substack.com/p/why-are-we-still-surprised-that-startups#footnote-6-138553423:~:text=In%20other%20words%2C%20building%20companies%20and%20products%20are)—months of daily practice, and not a two-week sprint.

Most AI applications are probably like that. There’s some data engineer at McKinsey who thought they were joining a bleeding-edge research group to build Lilli; instead, they are now the permanent maintainer of a pipeline that’s supposed to ingest interview transcripts from a dozen different SharePoint sites. There’s a team inside Atlassian that spent two days working with GPT, and is now on month six of figuring out how to reliably interact with Jira’s APIs.

Unless the company is existentially bound making these features work, it’s easy to imagine the various chatbots and assistants slowly spiraling into decay. A flashy launch goes out the door; the CEO touts their bold vision; [the stock shoots up](https://www.wallstreetzen.com/blog/ai-mention-moves-stock-prices-2023/). The initial version—rushed to market to satisfy an impatient Wall Street—is kind of a dud; it works fine on the simple requests, but falls down on the hard stuff that would be really valuable. But nobody is that upset, because nobody really wanted the feature that much in the first place. There was no burning need that it solved, or [pressing jobs for it to do](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done). It was mostly marketing, after all. So it stagnates in its half-built form, left in the product as demo candy, and to prove that the company is thinking about the future, until a new thing becomes the future, and we all move on. 

It’s a movie we saw just a few years ago with the blockchain—until AI became the future, and we all moved on. In 2015, [according to a survey](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC15_Technological_Tipping_Points_report_2015.pdf) conducted by the World Economic Forum, more than half of global business leaders thought that ten percent of global GDP would be stored on the blockchain by 2027.[^4] So, naturally, we bought some domains and built some useless products. 

In 2017, the Long Island Iced Tea Corp. [changed its name](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/12/iced-tea-company-changes-name-to-long-blockchain-stock-immediately-skyrockets) to Long Blockchain Corp., moved to longblockchain.com, and announced their intent to “leverage the benefits of blockchain technology.” In 2018, EY released “blockchain audit technology” called [EY Blockchain Analyzer](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2018/04/ey-announces-blockchain-audit-technology), saying it was the “first step in [their] ability to develop tools to test various blockchain-based business contracts.” Later that year, IBM and shipping giant Maersk launched [TradeLens](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/maersk-and-ibm-introduce-tradelens-blockchain-shipping-solution-300694642.html), “a blockchain-enabled shipping solution designed to promote more efficient and secure global trade.” In early 2022, JPMorgan Chase announced that they [were committing $12 billion](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/news-stories/tech-investment-could-disrupt-banking) to new tech investments, including projects for staying ahead of the blockchain revolution: “We believe blockchain technology can be a game changer in terms of process optimization, improved client experience, and the creation of new revenue streams.”

It didn’t go great? Long Blockchain Corp’s [stock also shot up](https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/943851385468211201)—but then they [stopped filing financial reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-22/long-blockchain-delisted-by-sec-after-riding-2017-s-crypto-craze#xj4y7vzkg) with the SEC, got [forcibly delisted](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nasdaq-to-delist-long-blockchain-corp-underlining-fading-bitcoin-fervor-2018-04-11) from the Nasdaq, never made any meaningful investments in blockchain technology, several people got charged [with insider trading](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/10/investing/blockchain-long-island-insider-trading/), and longblockchain.com now redirects to BestCryptoExchangeAustralia.com because, according to the site, Best Crypto Exchange Australia acquired the, uh, “established brand” of  Long Blockchain in 2021.[^5] IBM and Maersk—i.e., real companies—[shut down TradeLens](https://maritime-executive.com/article/maersk-and-ibm-abandon-blockchain-tradelens-platform) in 2022.[^6] EY and JPMorgan both shipped their products, but I suspect it took much longer than most people expected—they launched less than a month ago. On October 11, [JPMorgan went live](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-11/jpmorgan-jpm-launches-blockchain-settlement-in-blackrock-barclays-trade) “with its first collateral settlement for clients using blockchain;” on October 17, [EY announced](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2023/10/ey-announces-first-enterprise-user-to-leverage-ey-blockchains-saas-platform-using-fourth-generation-ey-blockchain-analyzer-reconciler) that Blockchain Analyzer: Reconciler had its first enterprise client. 

For companies launching AI products inside of existing, successful businesses,[^7] this is probably the reality of what’s coming next. Some will be hype-hunting frauds, a lot of products like TradeLens will never really take off, and some, from the companies that are really committed to making them work, might end up being [surprisingly useful](https://www.reddit.com/r/PwC/comments/17hym3g/chatpwc_a_game_changer_or_just_hype/). But without that effort, a lot of products will end up full of chatbots that get in our way, and there will be a lot of [glitter](https://twitter.com/mattturck/status/1720531277294493792) that isn’t gold.

# BI is a black hole, part 28

In addition to building an SQL-writing AI assistant, Equals, a web-based spreadsheet that connects to databases, recently [launched dashboards](https://equals.com/dashboards/). 

It was inevitable, I suppose. If you cross the BI event horizon—which I’d say is [building charts](https://benn.substack.com/p/we-dont-need-another-sql-chatbot#:~:text=If%20you%20build%20a%20product%20with%20charts%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20going%20to%20build%20a%20BI%20tool.%C2%A0) that users can edit—you get pulled by an endless series of customer requests into building a fully-featured business intelligence tool. At least [it looks cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA3Txp94pjs) before you get pulverized into oblivion by requests for row-based access controls, for skeuomorphic charts that look like a fuel gauge, and [PDF exports](https://twitter.com/barrald/status/1722782485560557991).

One of Equal’s promises, however, was that you wouldn’t need an export to *Excel*. When it first launched, Equals was unabashed in [its ambitions to replace Excel](https://wraptext.equals.com/equals-seed/). They were [going after the king](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-lrftLQaQ), [straight through the front door](https://benn.substack.com/i/138553423/go-in-the-front-door). But now, that message seems to have softened, and the [enemy is BI](https://equals.com/dashboards/). 

This new lean from Equals does raise an interesting question though: If Equals is becoming a BI tool, how has Excel—or perhaps more analogously, Google Sheets—*resisted* it? How have those products managed to remain distinct from BI, while tools like Equals, which was designed to be Excel “[if it were built today](https://wraptext.equals.com/equals-seed/),” are pulled into the black hole?

My best guess is Excel’s biggest weakness—that it’s disconnected from live data, and that every file is named monthly_results_final_v2_FINAL.xlsx—is actually its moat. What makes Excel (and Google Sheets) unique from BI is that it’s not just a tool for working with data; it *is* the data. You can create in it; you can update it without being afraid that you might break something else; you can share it, all in a single file. You can save it, and know, with total confidence, that when you open it tomorrow, next week, or next year, it’ll be the same as it was when you last left it. It’s not a tool for exploring and presenting data—which is what BI is for—but a sharable, self-contained sandbox for writing down numbers and adding them up. That makes replacing Excel a catch-22: If you build a tool that solves its biggest problems—being disconnected and static—you’re suddenly building a BI tool and not Excel. 

In Equals’ [launch post](https://wraptext.equals.com/equals-seed/), they said that the “spreadsheet is the best interface for working with data.” BI tools are for working with data. Excel is also for *storing* data. 

# Privatizing the efficiency gains

A common criticism of the 2008 bank bailouts was that they [privatized the gains and socialized the losses](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/opinion/01stiglitz.html#:~:text=the%20privatizing%20of%20gains%20and%20the%20socializing%20of%20losses). When bankers’ trades are good, they make money; when their trades blow up, taxpayers get the bill.

In some rough sense, the deal we sign with an employer when we take a job is that we’ll socialize our gains in exchange for socializing our losses. We get paid a steady salary, and the company takes on the risk that if we do something bad—like leaving an expensive computer running in the cloud for no reason—they’ll bear the cost. But if we do something good—like turn the expensive computer off—they get to keep the gains. They might fire us or promote us, but they lose—or make—the money.

In a recent blog post, an engineer who saved their company a lot of money by tweaking a few settings on their Snowflake database[^8] wants to [privatize the gains](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/):

> I ask management for a 30K raise after saving 500K and my message is still unread. I suspect I will eventually receive either nothing or 5K.

And from a [follow-up post](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/what-the-goddamn-hell-is-going-on-in-the-tech-industry/):

> There were some [other stories like the one from the first blog post], with a handful genuinely seeming to possibly add up to billions of dollars saved industry-wide, but the largest payout anyone ever received in the emails was $5K. Sampling bias, yadda yadda, listen, I'm pretty sure things are just fucked up.

I set up Mode’s Snowflake database a few years ago, and configured it in the same way that saved this other company $500,000, so, amen, pay me? But also, can you imagine a company that actually did this? Would I still get a $30,000 raise, or does it not count unless we wasted $500,000 first? What if I set up Snowflake to be egregiously inefficient, burning millions of dollars a year? Can I turn that down and collect ten percent of $5 million worth of savings? Can I collect ten percent of $5 million worth of savings because I *could’ve* set it up to be egregiously inefficient, but didn’t? If that’s too obvious, can I pay someone else to abuse Snowflake, with the promise of splitting my bonus with them when I fix it?

Or do we privatize the losses too? Should the blog post’s author’s company garnish $30,000 of some engineer’s wages for setting up Snowflake in a suboptimal way? If someone discovers a better configuration than what the author set up, do they have to pay that person part of their bonus? 

Why stop with cloud computing costs? Ship a bug; get charged for it. Resolve an urgent support ticket for a customer that’s in the middle of a tricky renewal; make five percent commission on the deal. Schedule an unnecessary meeting, [get charged $1,500](https://ramp.com/blog/meet-our-meeting-cost-calculator). Cancel that meeting, get paid $1,500—presumably, out of the pocket of the person who scheduled it. Start a [reply-all stampede](https://twitter.com/jessimurray/status/1011698751130427392) that takes down Outlook and prevents all of Microsoft from scheduling any meetings for two days? Get paid $10 million? Owe 100,000 people $100 each? Get fired? I have no idea.

This is probably why we don’t do this. But I love a [fun scheme](https://benn.substack.com/p/datas-invisible-hand), and would be very excited if someone tried it.

[^2]: Ironically, the premier enterprise chat application apparently has no clue what to do with chat-based generative AI technology. Like, what on earth is Slack actually announcing here? We’re told to “imagine” three times, what might happen “in the future” twice, and—in what is usually a [mechanical legal disclaimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward-looking_statement) but in this post feels like the only substantive part—that ”any unreleased services or features referenced in this or other press releases or public statements are not currently available and may not be delivered on time or at all.”

[^3]: Critically, this isn’t just about figuring out if you should tell the LLM it’s a “very helpful senior analyst” or a “expert in SQL,” or how [nicely you ask it questions](https://benn.substack.com/p/should-we-be-nice-to-chatgpt), though it is those things too. It’s also about testing now much schema metadata you provide in the prompt, if you provide sample queries or not, and various other inputs that can require days and weeks of effort to collect, before they can even be tested.

[^4]: Today, in 2023, cryptocurrencies are worth [$1.4 trillion](https://coinmarketcap.com/), compared to a global GDP of [$100 trillion](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=1W). NGMI.

[^5]: We’re already too far down this rabbit hole, but according to the [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2021/comp-pr2021-121.pdf), there is a deck somewhere called the “Blockchain Strategy Deck” that was instrumental in convincing the management team of Long Island Iced Tea Corp to “shift its business from soft drink manufacturing to blockchain technology.” Magnificent. It’s like the [infamous WeWork slides](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/the-best-slides-from-softbanks-wework-focused-earnings-report/), but also full of crimes.

[^6]: Why, you might ask? Because “[the need for full global industry collaboration has not been achieved](https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2022/11/29/maersk-and-ibm-to-discontinue-tradelens#:~:text=the%20need%20for%20full%20global%20industry%20collaboration%20has%20not%20been%20achieved),” obviously.

[^7]: This is to say nothing about products that are built for AI. A lot more of these will be frauds, a lot more will be somewhere between [awkward](https://hu.ma.ne/) and useless, and a lot will probably be useful. But all of them will at least be committed to the bit.

[^8]: Specifically, Snowflake customers pay for the amount of time the database is running. Snowflake will automatically turn itself off after some period of inactivity, and [you can tell it](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations#automating-warehouse-suspension) how long to wait before it does. It’s similar to a car engine; you don’t want to turn it off every time you take your foot off the gas, but don’t want to idle in a parking lot for ninety minutes either. To extend that analogy, Snowflake defaults to staying on during pauses of a few minutes, like stopping at a stoplight or waiting in line at a drive-thru; for a lot of customers, it’s probably fine to turn the car off in those moments.

In the fundraising fever dream of 2021, data startups got overvalued in three, sometimes compounding, ways. 

The first was the most obvious. In the wake of the pandemic and the policy responses to it, every company—public, private, tech, blue chip, [bleeding-edge AI companies](https://www.google.com/search?q=c3.ai+tcicker&sca_esv=582616455&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1043US1043&sxsrf=AM9HkKmb2rTALFiq6ON24WYd11z7Esk7Pg%3A1700054817733&ei=IcdUZdGnLOSV5OMPo764sAc&ved=0ahUKEwiRvIncjcaCAxXkCnkGHSMfDnYQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=c3.ai+tcicker&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDWMzLmFpIHRjaWNrZXIyBxAAGA0YgAQyBxAAGA0YgAQyCBAAGAgYHhgNMggQABiKBRiGAzIIEAAYigUYhgMyCBAAGIoFGIYDMggQABiKBRiGA0j_DlC7AVihDnAEeACQAQCYAaABoAGrB6oBAzMuNbgBA8gBAPgBAcICDhAAGIAEGLEDGIMBGLADwgIOEC4YgAQYxwEY0QMYsAPCAggQABiABBiwA8ICDRAAGIAEGBQYhwIYsAPCAhAQABiABBixAxiDARhGGPoBwgIIEAAYigUYkQLCAgUQABiABMICCxAuGIAEGMcBGNEDwgIKEAAYgAQYFBiHAsICBRAuGIAEwgIFECEYoAHiAwQYASBBiAYBkAYK&sclient=gws-wiz-serp), [hundred-year-old conglomerates that manufacture tape](https://www.google.com/search?q=3m+ticker&sca_esv=582616455&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1043US1043&biw=1772&bih=990&sxsrf=AM9HkKmf96PVHn5Ukay6uWA1w0wPW0eaMw%3A1700053299707&ei=M8FUZZDpKu38ptQPivWjgAM&ved=0ahUKEwjQzpyIiMaCAxVtvokEHYr6CDAQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=3m+ticker&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiCTNtIHRpY2tlcjIKEAAYgAQYFBiHAjIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHkianwFQxAlY-Z4BcAJ4AZABAJgBzgOgAc4LqgEHMC44LjQtMbgBA8gBAPgBAagCFMICChAAGEcY1gQYsAPCAgoQIxiKBRgnGJ0CwgIIEAAYigUYkQLCAgcQABiKBRhDwgIJEC4YigUYChhDwgILEC4YgAQYxwEY0QPCAgcQIxjqAhgnwgIWEAAYAxiPARjlAhjqAhi0AhiMA9gBAcICFhAuGAMYjwEY5QIY6gIYtAIYjAPYAQHCAgcQIxiKBRgnwgIEECMYJ8ICERAuGIAEGLEDGIMBGMcBGNEDwgILEC4YgAQYsQMYgwHCAggQABiABBixA8ICDhAAGIoFGLEDGIMBGJECwgITEC4YigUYsQMYgwEYxwEY0QMYQ8ICCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBwgINEC4YigUYxwEY0QMYQ8ICAhAm4gMEGAAgQYgGAZAGCLoGBggBEAEYCw&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)—was overvalued. From 2010 through the end of 2019, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500, which measures how highly companies are valued relative to how much money they’re making, [bounced between 13 and 24](https://www.macrotrends.net/2577/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chart). In 2020, it peaked at 38, almost double its prior averages.

Moreover, if 2020 and 2021 were outliers for the market, tech companies were outliers within the outlier. Public SaaS companies historically trade at valuations [five to ten times higher than their annual revenues](https://www.meritechcapital.com/benchmarking/historical-trading-data/ev-ntm-revenue); in 2021, the average multiple tripled to over thirty.[^1] The market’s [animal spirits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/animal-spirits.asp) quickly made their way down [Sand Hill Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_Hill_Road): By late 2021, median startup valuations were [two to three times higher](https://carta.com/blog/first-cut-state-of-private-markets-q1-2023/) than they’d been in 2020. If you walked into a venture capitalist’s office with a startup making $1 million and growing at 100 percent a year, the baseline valuation was about 50x its revenue, or $50 million dollars.

But the inflation didn’t stop there. Some companies got an additional bonus—a multiplier on their multiple—for being, in effect, corporate influencers. Companies with large Slack user groups or big Twitter followings got a 5x community multiple on their revenue multiple; popular open-source projects with lots of Github stars got a 3x Hacker News buzz multiple.[^2] Though startups like Facebook and Instagram popularized selling adoption metrics as a leading indicators of revenue growth, VCs have typically paid for *product* traction—daily active users, installs, time in the app. In 2021, investors were willing to pay premiums for looser, more atmospheric, more gameable, and less monetizable signs of progress. 

Finally, data companies got yet another boost—a third compounding multiplier—by positioning themselves as the pioneers of some new industry category. At a conference in late 2021, Martin Casado, an investor at Andreessen Horowitz, [predicted that the data industry](https://benn.substack.com/p/entity-layer#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWorkday%2C%20Salesforce%2C%20Adobe%E2%80%94they%E2%80%99re%20going%20to%20be%20reimplemented%20as%20apps%20on%20top%20of%20the%20data%20layer.%E2%80%9D) would be a trillion dollar market, and that, “Workday, Salesforce, Adobe—they’re going to be reimplemented as apps on top of the data layer.” This was a common sentiment then: Data technology was the next open frontier of computing, full of [green fields](https://medium.com/the-marketer-s-journey/what-is-the-greenfield-opportunity-and-how-to-discover-it-online-3b64c65b1ef3) and [blue oceans](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5647-blue-ocean-strategy.html), and it was time for a land grab. Investors rewarded companies that could claim to be leaders in some up-and-corner of [Matt Turck’s market diagram](https://mattturck.com/mad2023/)—in cataloging, observability, reverse ETL, orchestration, code-free data transformation, all-in-one aggregators, contracts, basically every [“fourth” category](https://benn.substack.com/i/136852343/die-a-hero-or-live-long-enough-to-become-alteryx)—with another bonus.

Nobody played this game better than Airbyte. In 2021, Airbyte raised $150 million at a $1.5 billion valuation [on less than $1 million in revenue](https://twitter.com/kenrickcai/status/1471958104623312898), booking, [famously](https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/25/infinite-revenue-multiples/), a 1,500x revenue multiple. They [published the deck](https://airbyte.com/blog/the-deck-we-used-to-raise-our-150m-series-b) they used to raise that round—and it was the perfect bait for investors’ [irrational exuberance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irrationalexuberance.asp).

First, the timing: They said their “initial plan was to raise the Series-B at the end of 2022” but decided to “test the waters in November [of 2021].” [Truly great call.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1bpgc) Second, the category multiplier: On the first slide of their pitch deck, they described a market on the cusp. “Data infrastructure is huge and growing, but still immature.” Reverse ETL, they said, was only two years old, current solutions only cover a small fraction of the market’s needs, and Airbye “will soon expand to all data movement use cases.” Third, the community multiplier: Before [saying a word about revenue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzAdXyPYKQo), they showed charts of active accounts, installs, how much data they were processing, and—on what they called “possibly one of the most important slides”—Slack community members, Github stars, and open source contributors. 

Multiply it all together—the default 50x 2021 multiple, a 5x category multiplier, a 5x community multiplier—and Airbyte’s $1 million in revenue is worth $1.25 billion. Throw in [some FOMO](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/fivetran-hauls-in-565m-on-5-6b-valuation-acquires-competitor-hvr-for-700m/) and the [round number bump](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/what-good-marathons-and-bad-investments-have-in-common.html), and it starts to almost make sense.

Or, it did. In 2021, when interest rates were zero, the Nasdaq was at [an all-time high](https://www.google.com/search?q=s%26p+500&sca_esv=583375078&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1043US1043&sxsrf=AM9HkKlWmYYMbY7ggfx8t8aCSHlicgW7Kw%3A1700237522261&ei=0pBXZZy-D-KiptQP8qy-4Ag&ved=0ahUKEwic77CstsuCAxVikYkEHXKWD4wQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=s%26p+500&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiB3MmcCA1MDAyCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBMhAQABiABBiKBRixAxiDARhDMgoQABiABBgUGIcCMgsQABiABBixAxiDATILEAAYgAQYsQMYgwEyCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBxAAGIAEGAoyEBAuGIAEGLEDGMcBGNEDGApIrxVQrgdYgBRwA3gBkAEAmAFtoAH_AaoBAzIuMbgBA8gBAPgBAcICBxAjGLADGCfCAgoQABhHGNYEGLADwgIKEAAYigUYsAMYQ8ICDhAAGOQCGNYEGLAD2AEBwgIWEC4YigUYxwEY0QMYyAMYsAMYQ9gBAsICBBAAGB7CAgYQABgeGArCAgwQLhgeGMcBGNEDGAriAwQYACBBiAYBkAYRugYGCAEQARgJugYGCAIQARgI&sclient=gws-wiz-serp), and [Peloton](https://www.google.com/search?q=peloton+ticker&sca_esv=582673243&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1043US1043&sxsrf=AM9HkKk0pBeeTPSFqouaMYX4De9-m9RIAA%3A1700066967851&ei=l_ZUZf_NM7elptQPh4ufgAI&oq=peltaton+ticker&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiD3BlbHRhdG9uIHRpY2tlcioCCAAyChAjGLACGCcYnQIyCBAAGAgYHhgNMggQABgIGB4YDTIIEAAYCBgeGA0yCBAAGAgYHhgNMggQABiKBRiGAzIIEAAYigUYhgNI4DVQsQdY-S1wDngBkAEEmAHoBKABhiKqAQsyLjguMi4xLjEuM7gBAcgBAPgBAcICChAAGEcY1gQYsAPCAgoQABiKBRiwAxhDwgIGEAAYBxgewgIHEAAYgAQYCsICChAAGIAEGBQYhwLCAggQABgHGB4YCsICDRAAGIoFGLEDGIMBGEPCAgQQABge4gMEGAAgQYgGAZAGCg&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) was worth more than [Ford](https://www.google.com/search?q=ford+ticker&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1043US1043&oq=ford+ticker&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg70gEIMTU3M2owajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), these effects compounded up*.* Today, when interest rates are [over five percent](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS), benchmark revenue multiples are [down sixty to seventy percent](https://www.meritechcapital.com/benchmarking/historical-trading-data/ev-ntm-revenue), and Peloton is worth less than [WD-40](https://www.google.com/search?q=WDFC+ticker&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1043US1043&oq=wdfc+ticker&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg70gEIMzIzNGowajmoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), the numbers compound *down*.

New categories aren’t billion-dollar opportunities, but [unproven markets](https://twitter.com/mattturck/status/1724894715420786863) that no buyer has any budget for.[^3] Github stars [aren’t cool anymore](https://dagster.io/blog/fake-stars);[^4] even Matt Turck [is over](https://twitter.com/mattturck/status/1721671866882916720) Matt Turck’s market diagram. 

The compression math is brutal. The baseline multiple that VCs would now apply to Airbyte, for example, is probably down from 50x to 15x. The community and category multiples are, generously, 2x instead of 5x. Add it up, and the 1,500x company that’s worth $1.5 billion becomes the 60x company that’s worth $60 million.[^5]

The bad news is that it would be a disaster for Airbyte to be worth $60 million.[^6] The good news is that Airbyte isn’t worth $60 million; it’s worth $1.5 billion. Until Airbyte and its many contemporaries who also raised at the top of the market in 2021 raise money again, the fair market value of their shares are unknown.[^7] Uninformed idiots can write wildly speculative blog posts about them, but that’s it. Someone has to [open the box for us to know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat) if the cat—the startup, the opportunity, the magic, the dream of changing the world—is still alive. 

One option is to not open the box. [There is nothing good in the box.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHpHxLZReiI) Save money; keep building; only open the box when you’ve “[grown into your valuation.](https://twitter.com/Kellblog/status/1580943374428667905)” 

That’s tough, though. For 2023 Airbyte to be worth the same as 2021 Airbyte, 2023 Airbyte needs to be making about $25 million a year. Getting to $25 million from $1 million would require growing by 300 percent for three straight years. Though Airbyte has surely grown, they probably haven’t grown at 300 percent a year for three straight years since 2021 because that’s very hard to do in good markets, because this is not a good market, and because 2021 was two years ago. Unless a company is profitable or close to it,[^8] they’ll have to open the box eventually.

Another option is to open the box, but not tell anyone what’s inside? Anecdotally, I’ve seen a handful of companies that had previously raised large rounds with publicly disclosed valuations raise new, vaguely-named “venture rounds” that have no letter (e.g., Series A, Series B) and no price. These are probably down rounds, but ones that companies can plausibly deny as such. We didn’t need the money; we wanted to double-down on our groundbreaking AI investments to [keep ahead of the competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlM6lcFbLSg).[^9] It wasn’t about the price; it was getting strategic investors on the cap table. The leaked reports of the cat’s death are greatly exaggerated. 

The best option, probably, is to raise money opportunistically. Private companies aren't valued by the aggregated opinion of the market, but by a single highest bidder. If a startup can convince one fund that, sure, the magic community and category multipliers are dead, but the [magic AI](https://www.tiktok.com/@redpoint/video/7301766324898843947) multiplier is higher than ever, it can potentially raise money at its prior valuation. The check might be smaller; the investor might be worse; there could be a lot of [structure](https://kruzeconsulting.com/blog/structured-term-sheets-late-stage-venture-capital/) on the term sheet. But it sends a signal to the market—to customers, to competitors, and to people who write tabloid gossip—that, despite the bad market, the company is the same as it ever was: A [once-in-a-lifetime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IsSpAOD6K8) opportunity.

Databricks recently closed a round exactly like this. In the fall of 2021, Databricks raised $1.6 billion at a [$38 billion valuation](https://www.databricks.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/databricks-raises-1-6-billion-series-h-investment-at-38-billion-valuation). Almost exactly two years later, in September of this year, they closed a $500 million round at a [$43 billion valuation](https://www.databricks.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/databricks-raises-series-i-investment-43b-valuation).

Did Databricks need the money? Did they want T. Rowe Price, Nvidia, and [Capital One](https://venturebeat.com/ai/databricks-raises-500-million-with-backing-from-rival-snowflakes-top-client/) on the cap table? Did they raise it because now’s the moment [invest in generative AI](https://www.databricks.com/blog/what-is-a-data-intelligence-platform), and they wanted to [amp it up](https://www.amazon.com/Amp-Unlocking-Hypergrowth-Expectations-Intensity/dp/1119836115)? I have no idea. It could all be corporate financial maneuvering. But it’d be hard to believe the valuation didn’t have *something* to do with it. By closing the round, Databricks can put a [loud end](https://www.tiktok.com/@alfonpracannes/video/7300447873974488326) to the [endless speculation](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Is-Databricks-valuation-at-risk-of-decreasing-tjMA8SV4): The 2023 market has spoken, the [discounts aren’t necessary](https://www.ft.com/content/237a5096-8bbc-41b6-bf7e-43a133e1edcf#:~:text=said%20it%20had%20applied%20a%2020%20per%20cent%20discount%20to%20private%20market%20stake%20sales%20of%20Databricks.), and Databricks is as valuable as ever. 

I doubt they’ll be the last to do it. Today, everyone assumes everything is overvalued and every cat is dead. Surely, there are a number of other companies quietly canvasing the market—”we’re not raising now, but would be excited to bring on the right strategic partner”— looking for that one investor that can give them the multiple they need to prove otherwise. In the coming months, I suspect there will be more rounds that are as much about messaging as they are money: Though the room may be on fire, the dream is still possible, the cat is alive, and everything is fine. 

# Good VC, Bad VC, Useful VC

Every four years, I entertain the possibility of working for a political campaign. There’s some structural appeal in the job to me. Major campaigns are like extremely fast-growing startups, raising hundreds of millions of dollars and hiring thousands of people in a matter of months. But unlike startups, campaigns are built to expire. You aren’t chasing an uncertain IPO or acquisition some unknown distance over the horizon; instead, you know, on the Wednesday after the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, it’s over. You spend all of your money; you find out if you won or lost; you go home. 

So, every four years, I email a handful of people who are working on campaigns and ask if there are ways I, [an egomaniacal tech person](https://benn.substack.com/p/am-i-the-jared-kushner), can help. And every four years, they tell me the same thing: No. Working on a campaign isn’t a drive-by job; it requires real expertise; if you show up once a week for a few hours, you’ll just get in the way.[^10] There are lots of part-time jobs on campaigns—knocking on doors, making phone calls, *the real work*—and if you want to help, do that. But we have no use for people who are looking to parachute in with context-free opinions about something they partially understand so that they can feel good about themselves. 

Speaking of venture capitalists, I recently came across an old [Christoph Janz post](https://medium.com/point-nine-news/good-vcs-bad-vcs-7afeed1780b1) about what makes them good and bad. In it, he warns VCs about volunteering on the campaign:

> A **good VC** is aware that there is a huge information gap between founders and VCs with respect to the founder’s business. He understands that the founder has thousands of hours of experience in his industry and with his customers and intimately knows the people on his team, whereas the VC’s knowledge of the startup is often much more superficial. He understands that many if not most of the ideas he will come up with are things that the founder has already considered and knows that while he can provide great input, advice and a different perspective, he should neither try to micro-manage nor try to make decisions for the founders….
> A **bad VC** overestimates his insights, tries to micro-manage, tries to exercise control and becomes a maintenance burden for the founders.

Sure, yes, however: What sort of “advice” is actually useful? 

Most commonly, that advice is an opinion—“here’s what I think makes sense; here’s how I’d reason about the problem; here’s my feedback on what you’re saying.” Generously, it’s an effort by VCs to solve the puzzle together; cynically, it’s their attempt to prove how smart they are. 

The problem with opinions, aside from often being wrong, is that they’re easy to ignore. It’s easy for startups to say, “we have thousands of hours of experience in our industry and with our customers and intimately know the people on our team, whereas the VC’s knowledge of our startup is much more superficial.” Then they nod and say thank you and move on. And more often than not, [that’s probably the right decision](https://benn.substack.com/p/why-are-we-still-surprised-that-startups#:~:text=The%20company%E2%80%99s%20CEO%20says%20thank%20you%2C%20that%20they%E2%80%99ll%20look%20into%20it%2C%20and%20then%20forwards%20the%20email%20to%20their%20trash%20can.).

But there is a kind of advice that I wish more VCs would give: Tell startups what you think is going to happen next. VCs have seen a thousand companies make a thousand decisions and know how they’ve all played out. Don’t try to synthesize that into a clever plan; *just play the tape. *

“I know you think you can do both of those things at once. Maybe you’re different, but every other time I’ve seen a company try that, they got distracted, first like this, then then, and then these bad things started to happen.”

“I know you think you’re going to build something [that’s not BI](https://benn.substack.com/i/138759555/bi-is-a-black-hole-part). Maybe you’re different, but every other time that’s been attempted it’s become BI.”

Tell the stories. Do it with details. Don’t tell us what you think; tell us [what you’ve seen](https://youtu.be/QefqJ7YhbWQ?si=YkbvyrE_ir7lLoaw&t=117). As I’ve [said before](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-an-acquisition-fails#:~:text=most%20companies%20aren%E2%80%99t%20killed%20by%20some%20obscure%20threat%20lurking%20in%20the%20weeds%20that%20they%20never%20see%3B%20they%E2%80%99re%20killed%20by%20the%20thing%20that%20everyone%20knew%20about%2C%20everyone%20saw%2C%20everyone%20felt%2C%20and%20nobody%20fully%20faced.), most startups are “killed by the thing that everyone knew about, everyone saw, everyone felt, and *nobody fully faced*.” Good VCs are humble advisors, bad VCs are overconfident micromanagers, and useful VCs tell the blunt stories that make sure startups fully face what’s probably coming next.

[^1]: Why not use P/E ratios here? One, because I couldn’t find them after three Google searches and I gave up. And two, I’m not sure aggregate P/E ratios make as much sense for SaaS companies because a lot of their earnings [are negative](https://www.meritechcapital.com/benchmarking/financial-metrics/fcf-margin-ltm)? But maybe they do? I don’t know. I work for startups; we’re supposed to make fun of MBAs and their bean counting. For revolutionaries like us, accounting figures [are rough values, and could be slightly off; there is also obviously a chance of typos etc.](https://www.ft.com/content/0c2a55b6-d34c-4685-8a8d-3c9628f1f185)

[^2]: These exact numbers are a joke; I doubt that VCs literally did this sort of math. But I’m sure these signals were part of their mental calculus. “Yes, this startup only has three paying customers, but their launch got 400 upvotes on Product Hunt, so we’re gonna YOLO an observer-only term sheet at them for [$20 million on a $100 million post](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-snowflake-fails#:~:text=The%20default%20Series%20A%20term%20sheet%20was%20a%20%2420%20million%20raise%20on%20a%20working%20prototype%20and%20a%20%24100%20million%20valuation.).”

[^3]: “In some categories, pretty much all companies are/would be up for sale.” The point here is subtly devastating. For some data startups, they aren’t just overvalued; they solve a problem that the market doesn’t put any meaningful value on solving. Such is the risk of investing in green fields; they might be undiscovered fertile lands, or they might be deserts.

[^4]: But what about content marketing that [gets lots of upvotes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35207020) on Hacker News? (Disclosure: I’m a [very small investor](https://benn.substack.com/p/disclose-your-angel-investments) in Dagster.)

[^5]: If that seems low, it is—for, uh, Facebook, when it was going absolutely vertical in 2005. That year, less than two years after its founding, Facebook had [5 million users](https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/10/facebook-5/), was the [seventh most popular website](https://about.fb.com/news/2006/04/facebook-secures-25m-investment-2/) on the internet, and was making [$9 million](https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-ipo-facebook-ipo-facebook-ipo/#:~:text=%249%20million%20in%20revenue%20in%202005) in revenue, which was up 2,300 percent from 2004. For that explosive growth, Facebook was rewarded with a valuation of [$550 million](https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/10/facebook-5/)—or 61x their revenue.

[^6]: [In a prior post](https://benn.substack.com/p/take-the-down-round), I said that down rounds are mostly a fictional disaster, and I still think that’s true. However, going from $1.5 billion to $60 million is an extreme case; it would obviously be very bad if a company turned $200 million in cash into a warped preference stack full of some risky preferred shares worth a total of $60 million and a bunch of common shares worth $0. But less extreme down rounds—[going from $1.5 billion to $1 billion, say](https://benn.substack.com/p/take-the-down-round#footnote-6-136639841)—aren’t as economically bad as they’re made out to be.The problem with down rounds, even the more modest ones, is their psychological effect. VCs want to invest in exciting businesses; down rounds [signal](https://benn.substack.com/p/take-the-down-round#footnote-6-136639841:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20a%20down%20round.%20And%20in%20the%20zeitgeist%20of%20Silicon%20Valley%2C%20they%E2%80%99re%20a%20disaster.%20They%E2%80%99re%20humbling%20comedowns%3B%20big%20falls%20from%20grace%3B%20catastrophic%20events%20that%20are%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20worst%20possible%20thing%20that%20can%20happen%20outside%20of%20a%20tragic%20accident%20of%20some%20sort.%E2%80%9D%C2%A0) that the business is no longer exciting. [From Matt Levine this week:](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-13/some-startups-need-a-second-chance)WeWork is probably the funniest, but there are lots of companies like this, companies that were funded by venture capital firms in the boom based on ambitious growth targets and plans to change the world, and that failed to achieve those ambitions, but that are, you know, fine, viable, possibly even profitable one day.In some ways that is the worst way to fail? For a startup founded by a visionary entrepreneur and funded by venture capitalists? Like:...The awkward, what-do-we-do-now outcome is that you don’t change the world, the company chugs along, it makes enough money to pay salaries and maybe open an office in Dallas and perhaps write a quarterly dividend check to its VCs. But the VCs are like “I do not want a quarterly dividend check, a quarterly dividend check isn’t cool, you know what is cool, a trillion dollars.” And the founder is like “man I am paying myself $400,000 a year and working on the problem that excited me five years ago but I am not a billionaire and why am I in Dallas.”A down round by itself doesn’t mean a company can’t change the world. But it does mean that people no longer believe it can, and in Silicon Valley, that can be enough to ruin a company. Or at least force it to sell itself to a PE firm in Dallas.

[^7]: Yes, there are secondary markets, but these aren’t a great barometer. For most startups, shares aren’t very liquid, transaction volume is low, and people buy and sell for messy reasons (they want to put a down payment on a house and need the cash; an institutional investor needs to retire a fund; etc.).

[^8]: Though honestly, being profitable isn’t a panacea. A profitable company making tens of millions of dollars a year in revenue—which is on the high end of where a lot of data startups are today—is how you end up in Dallas, working on a problem that excited you five years ago.

# Tribal accelerationism

*The OpenAI circus puts us back where we started—but now we’re more polarized. And some clickbait on why Sam Altman isn’t special.*

---

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VQTF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec2defee-a46b-4d29-b48b-273f2bdc3f95_1600x900.png)
*[Choose your team.](https://classic.esquire.com/article/1983/3/1/philosopher-robert-nozick-vs-philosopher-john-rawls)*

One way to describe OpenAI’s boardroom civil war is as a fight between two people who wanted to go faster, and four people who wanted to be more cautious. Though tedious people can debate the exact way to label each side—[effective accelerationists](https://effectiveaccelerationism.substack.com/p/repost-effective-accelerationism) versus decels and effective altruists; [techno-optimists](https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/) versus [the skeptics](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2023/10/techno-optimism-is-not-something-you-should-believe-in); capitalists versus researchers; for-profit versus non-profit; builders versus an escalating variety of derogatory slurs; “move fast and break things” versus “move fast with a stable hold on the continued existence of humanity”—the lines between the two sides are pretty clear.[^1] 

Both sides make reasonable points. Some people on the more deliberate side—including [various serious thinkers and Elon Musk](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/28/1100-notable-signatories-just-signed-an-open-letter-asking-all-ai-labs-to-immediately-pause-for-at-least-6-months/), [leading AI researchers](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2023/nov/02/ilya-the-ai-scientist-shaping-the-world), and [multiple](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/technology/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt.html) [CEOs](https://twitter.com/MorningBrew/status/1726645792176546108) of OpenAI—believe that artificial general intelligence could, quite literally, destroy the world and annihilate the human race. Other people worry that advanced AI technologies may not be outright apocalyptic, but will be dangerously disruptive. Just as we [weren’t ready for a world](https://www.piratewires.com/p/jump-23d06adb4cb7) in which any idea can reach hundreds millions of people in minutes, we aren’t ready for a world in which every image could be fake and every [familiar voice could be a scam](https://twitter.com/ArmandDoma/status/1726712587747045822). 

The side that wants to go faster is motivated by an inverted set of beliefs. Some of them think that AGI won’t kill the human race, but create for it an eternal utopia where there are no problems and everyone is happy.[^2] Others believe in a weaker version of that, in which AI cures every disease, builds a real room-temperature superconductor, and finally figures out [how to board an airplane in under 45 minutes](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/business/airlines-are-trying-to-cut-boarding-times-on-planes.html).[^3] It may cause problems, they admit, but the long arc of the technological universe bends towards prosperity, or at least highly efficient real-time ad auctions. And both of those are good things.

Moreover, for most people, it’s not clear how the continued advance of AI would affect them personally. If AI is the transformative technology that many claim it could be, it represents a kind of [Rawlsian discontinuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position): It resets the rules of the giant social game we’ve all been playing—and nobody knows what the rules of the new game will be. Though lots of things can upend today’s social order, generative AI could do it in a particularly profound and unpredictable way. It could make everyone funny on Twitter; it could destroy entire professions that some people have committed their lives to; it could [make intelligence an unremarkable asset](https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1710462485411561808). 

I’d guess that a lot of people’s feelings about AI are driven by what they think is on the other side of that Rawlsian veil. Those who are anxious about it prefer the way things are, rather than the way things could become. Some of that may be aesthetic—they’d rather read books and weekly blog posts and snarky tweets and clever legal briefs that are created by a human—and some of it may be self-preserving—they *write* books and weekly blog posts and snarky tweets and clever legal briefs, and like the position that that skill has afforded them in today’s society. 

Conversely, people who are pushing ahead probably believe that the new rules will be written in their favor. Sure, AI might usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity and human achievement, but more importantly, it might also usher in an era of *personal* prosperity and achievement. Nobody says that [a rising tide lifts all boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rising_tide_lifts_all_boats) when the higher tide requires them to exchange their big boat for a small one. People say it when they want the people in the small boats to shut up. 

At first glance, it’s not immediately obvious which team someone would choose. AGI could save the world; AGI could destroy it. Less dramatic technological advances could tilt the social order in my favor; they could invert it against me. It could make me rich; it could make me expendable.[^4]  They are all real [flips of an actual Sam Coin](https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-bankman-fried-coin-flip-destroy-world-caroline-ellison-trial-2023-10). All else equal, you’d expect some variability on which bet to make.

If there were disagreements before last week, there aren’t anymore. 

When Sam Altman got fired, Silicon Valley was nearly unanimous in its support of Altman—justifiably, perhaps, given the seemingly clownish circumstances behind his removal. Then, however, via some transitive property of online warfare, support for Altman quickly blurred into support for the unchecked pursuit of a technology that most people acknowledge could be dangerous. Now, people are not only hesitant to side with the ousting board; they were hesitant to say we should [hear the board out](https://twitter.com/EricNewcomer/status/1726347773405274357).[^5] 

Perhaps Altman and the accelerationists are right; perhaps we should be doing everything we can to build advanced AIs as fast as we can. I don’t know; as I said, reasonable people can disagree. But I think it’s important to recognize what Silicon Valley’s mass support for that movement is becoming—base tribalism.

People aren’t rushing to defend Altman and OpenAI’s mission after carefully studying the creative or destructive potential of AI, or after concluding that it’s not a seismic revolution but “just” the next megatrend, because, first, most people haven’t, and second, those who have are still pretty split on how far AI could go, and whether an all-powerful superintelligence will break good or break bad. Nor did people bring out the pitchforks when Altman was fired, and the [gloating celebrations](https://twitter.com/DataChaz/status/1726305175454040335) when he was rehired, solely because they believe OpenAI will make the [world a better place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8C5sjjhsso). Call me a cynic, but venture capitalists don’t typically rush to Twitter to protect their ability to selflessly help others. 

No, the masses sided with Altman—and now, accelerationism more generally—because Silicon Valley is our team; OpenAI is “ours;” Sam Altman is one of us. The other side is now the enemy; they are delicate and weak-kneed weenies; [we are builders](https://twitter.com/ShaanVP/status/1727412911562449129), the Chads, the undeterred pioneers for the human race. “E/acc” is a brand—a flag—not a philosophy that every reply guy researched before they add it to their Twitter handle. And AGI is no longer a technology to be respectfully feared; it [is a battle cry](https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1727430371195998639). 

Now that Altman is back as CEO, it’s easy to look at last week as some Macbethian melodrama, [full of sound and fury, signifying nothing](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56964/speech-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow). I don’t think that’s true. Yes, all the pieces may be back where they started, but the sound and fury was significant: It was a [Scissor event](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/) that snapped Silicon Valley into polarized tribes. Before last week, there were measured disagreements about AI. Now, there is dissent, there is The Way, and there is a blind march into the unknown.

# Sam Altman isn’t special

I like this [Under Armour commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsovD9IlT3U). It’s mostly a montage of gymnasts training in a dark and disheveled gym. They fall; they get hurt; they get up; over and over again, with nobody else watching. In the final few seconds, we see the gymnasts walking into a competition, wearing Team USA leotards. “It’s what you do in the dark,” the ad says, “that puts you in the light.”

The commercial doesn’t just describe how Olympians succeed; it also, it seems, describes Sam Altman’s success. When Altman became the internet’s main character last week, a handful of people wondered out loud why he’s so popular in Silicon Valley. Prior to taking the top job at OpenAI, Altman’s resume didn’t look like that of the typical tech icon. Though he dropped out of Stanford to found a startup, his company was a middling success at best; it was acquired for [slightly more money than it had raised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt). He then became the [President of Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/sam-altman-for-president), mostly, it seemed, because YC’s cofounder Paul Graham was stepping down, and because Graham liked Altman. He moved from YC to OpenAI, where he’s become one of the most prominent and powerful people in the tech industry. In an industry that reveres founders and engineers, Altman’s credentials as both are uncommonly thin.

Altman’s supporters say he’s been successful for two other reasons. The first is that he’s [an exceptionally good dealmaker](https://twitter.com/loganbartlett/status/1726612744609382711).[^6] The second—and the far more common answer—is that Altman was relentlessly helpful to those around him. As the OpenAI news broke last Friday and everyone was trying to piece together what had happened, people began posting stories about the helpful things Altman had quietly done, when nobody was looking. He [mentored young founders](https://twitter.com/adamguild/status/1725702103677772174) who others had ignored. He made [key introductions](https://twitter.com/typesfast/status/1725869138235490424). He gave people [advice and feedback](https://twitter.com/borisjabes/status/1725934950653042877). He [opened his house](https://twitter.com/gillinghammer/status/1725764624732029173) for weddings. These things, [people said](https://twitter.com/benja22083/status/1725911523061637554), were what made Altman special. His legend wasn't built on a single accomplishment, but out of thousands of small acts of kindness. We can only know Altman and his character by looking at the entire mosaic.

Is the picture true? I have no idea. Some skepticism is probably healthy. [Peer pressure](https://twitter.com/JacquesThibs/status/1727134087176204410) is a powerful thing, and there are a lot of self-serving reasons to declare yourself a loyal Altman disciple, especially if you can name-drop your relationship with him along the way. But I don't know Altman, and the support he's gotten over the last week is genuinely impressive. So let's take it at face value: Altman is who the stories say he is, and the work that Altman did in the dark is what put him in the light.

But here’s the thing—there are lots of people who do the same work. Not everyone; far from it; Altman’s willingness to help others is uncommon. But it isn’t singular. What is unique about Altman—what separates him from the other people in Silicon Valley who are also irrepressibly kind and unrelentingly helpful, who are also there when nobody is looking—is that Altman’s had his stories told. For others, their kindness stays in the dark; their mosaics remain incomplete.[^7] 

[Matt Knopp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewknopp/) has one such mosaic. He’s pulled multiple all-nighters to bail me out of dumb mistakes I’ve made.[^8] He’s always been there to help, no matter how foreign—or how boring—my ask of him was. He’s spent countless hours teaching me how things work; he’s been the uncredited technical backstop to hundreds of customer calls, support tickets, and investor pitches I’ve given; he’s fixed the literal holes in my shoes. Whatever stories people can tell about Sam, I can tell about Matt. 

There are so many others. Both [Chris Davis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherdavis6/) and [Asha Hill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashahill/) selflessly stepped into several new roles when someone else needed help, always willing to sacrifice their own comfort so that others, myself included, could succeed. If you needed help with anything—brainstorming a product design, editing a movie, making a birthday card, transforming a slide deck, finishing a hack day project at 4 a.m., despite having four others that she’s already working on—[Sam Ferguson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/novaksam/) was there. [Heather Rivers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hrivers) bailed me out of a job that was destroying me, even though she knew it would eventually destroy her. In ten years, I’ve never heard a bad word or single complaint about [Paul Thurlow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pthurlow/). [Bailey Douglass](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baileydouglass/) always answered the phone, no matter how messy the problem on the other end of the line was going to be.

[Alana Goyal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanagoyal/) responds to every email with unnerving speed. [Jon Hawkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonhawkinsnyc/), [Miju Han](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miju-han/), [Denis Zgonjanin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deniszgonjanin/), [Maura Church](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datatime/), [Drew Harry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewharry/), and [Perry Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/perrwa/) have all taken dozens of customer reference calls, answered investor diligence questions, participated in last-minute events, and provided hours of product feedback and advice, never asking for anything in return. [Leqi Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leqi-long-34785b2b/), [Jennifer Chu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferchu888/), and [Joel Carron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-carron-1925a74a/) never forgot a coworker’s birthday, or the type of candy they liked. After buying me breakfast, [Chase Roberts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chasecroberts/) remembered a brief comment in our conversation and sent me a book. [Monique Morales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-morales-43127143/) saved me when I forgot to book a room for a party. Without me ever telling her, [Maura Ginty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauraginty/) figured out I wanted to spend more time in New York, and found ways to send me there. [Aashna Dhawan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aashnadhawan/) opened her family’s home to my luggage, when I needed a temporary storage unit for two days. And [Emily Ritter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emritter/) never stopped listening.

I know some of these people well; some are professional passersby. I have stories about some of them that are profoundly meaningful to me; some are brief moments of kindness. But each of them are tiles, just like those that cover Sam Altman’s canvas. And the only difference between their tiles and Altman’s is how much people share them. 

Shortly after getting fired, [Altman tweeted](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1725742088317534446) that the experience “has been sorta like reading your own eulogy while you’re still alive. the outpouring of love is awesome.” One takeaway, he said, was that everyone should “go tell your friends how great you think they are.”

Yes, but no. Don’t tell your friends how great they are; tell the world how great your friends are. Altman is where he is because of that. If you believe someone is underappreciated for what they’ve done, or if you have someone to be grateful for—it is Thanksgiving, after all—don’t appreciate them in the dark. Put them in the light.

[^1]: There is a third team, I suppose, which sees the other two as prima donnas competing in a [demented goat rodeo](https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1727261357874229594).

[^2]: They post [this picture](https://hsosc.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/futuristic-city-hsosc.jpg) a lot.

[^3]: Of course, the answer here is simple: Make baggage claim faster. It seems fairly obvious that boarding a plane isn’t a Tetris problem about the order in which the rows are filled, but a psychological one about [people who don’t want to check their bags](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pofUsd9hEi8). If airlines could convince people to check more suitcases, and everyone boarding a plane had a purse and a backpack, I bet they could load (and unload) an entire A320 in under fifteen minutes. That would save airlines [about 30 minutes](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/business/airlines-are-trying-to-cut-boarding-times-on-planes.html#:~:text=It%20now%20takes%2030%20to%2040%20minutes%20to%20board%20about%20140%20passengers%20on%20a%20domestic%20flight)—[or $3,000](https://www.airlines.org/dataset/u-s-passenger-carrier-delay-costs/)—per flight. For Delta, which operates [4,000 flights a day](https://news.delta.com/corporate-stats-and-facts), that saves $12 million a day, and $4 billion a year. For $4 billion, surely, *surely, *you could figure out fast way to get people to tag their bags at the gate, to hand them off as they’re boarding the plane, and to quickly bring them up to the destination gate as soon as the plane lands.

[^4]: Though some people—notably Sam Altman—could become extraordinarily rich and powerful, most of our fortunes are less certain. If technology is king, people in Silicon Valley could benefit by working in that profession, via the general elevation of the industry as the new master of the universe. Or we could lose, and badly, if our jobs as people typing on a computer lose their value and prestige.

[^5]: Judgment decels.

[^6]: It’s ironic that the current It Boy in Silicon Valley—a place that has long fancied itself as being above politics—[Is Him](https://www.tiktok.com/@nfl/video/7143640716294753582) because he’s politically savvy. In the land of the willfully blind, [the man who opens his eyes is king](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_the_land_of_the_blind,_the_one-eyed_man_is_king).

[^7]: Importantly, this is how everyone advances. People’s careers are built on their reputations, and their reputations are built on the stories that circulate in the zeitgeist. And these reputations snowball, compounding on top of each other over time. Imagine, for instance, that someone is asked who they think is good in a department that they don’t work with very often. Most people would say something like, “I’m not sure, but I’ve heard that Brian* is good.” Or, a CEO gets up on stage and jokes, “We’ve got some big deals this quarter; Patrick*—where’s Patrick?—don’t get married again this month, ok?” These recommendations and jokes are often based on nothing but reputation, but they also self-reinforcing; now, more people think Brian and Patrick are good too. This is why *informal* [sponsors](https://hbr.org/2021/10/whats-the-difference-between-a-mentor-and-a-sponsor) are so important—people don’t succeed because they do great work; they succeed because people talk about their work. * Men tend to informally sponsor men. Though they may *formally *recommend women, that often matters less than the pervasive, offhand comments on which reputations are actually built. And men usually joke about and casually promote other men.

*[Drink your unstructured milkshake.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_hFTR6qyEo)*

Imagine that you finally did it. You left your tech job—high-paying, ostensibly prestigious, [amenity-maxed but catatonic](https://twitter.com/NaithanJones/status/1729676196168818802)—for the tactile life, and [opened a bar](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-much-for-that-dag-in-the-window#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20to%20know%20the%20id%20of%20white%20man%20in%20tech%2C%20ask%20him%20what%20kind%20of%20bar%20he%20wants%20to%20open.%C2%A0).

However, as both a former enlightened data professional and a [hungry overachiever with a deep-rooted need to win](https://www.sequoiacap.com/our-ethos/#:~:text=hungry%20overachievers%20with%20a%20deep%2Drooted%20need%20to%20win), you couldn’t go full analog. If you’re going to run a bar, it’s going to be [the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1UOk6nVzpE)—and the best businesses [use data](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/five-facts-how-customer-analytics-boosts-corporate-performance). Your Square account [streams every transaction](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/square) into Databricks. Hundreds of tiny scales constantly measure the weight of every liquor bottle, providing by-the-minute snapshots of your current inventory. You [track foot traffic](https://www.getdor.com/solutions/people-counting) into your bar; you track how loud every corner is; you track all the climate readings from your Nest. You purchase demographic data about your customers. You collect market data to find popular liquors and beers. You build custom pipelines that trawl TikTok and YouTube for [viral new cocktails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvnqfLKEqrc). You keep your data in pristine condition, perfectly modeled, fully documented, constantly monitored and exhaustively tested. Your dashboards are both seasonally adjusted *and *weather-adjusted, using local temperature and precipitation data [bought from the Databricks Marketplace](https://marketplace.databricks.com/details/f77ce13a-2655-4331-a892-dbd69723cc41/AWIS-Weather-Services_Worldwide-Hourly-Historical-Weather-Data-Climate-Data-Human-Checked-Weather-Data-starting-in-). Your bar is a digital native; a smart bar; a bar built for the [internet of things](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-case-for-being-biased#:~:text=Oh%2C%20sorry.%20I%20just%20got%20really%20excited%20about%20the%20internet%20of%20things).

Your bar is also failing. 

It’s never empty, but rarely full enough to cover your costs. Stressed by the bar’s struggles, you take a week off to clear your head. While you’re gone, a friend decides to help out. They offer a free beer to any customer in exchange for two minutes of stream-of-consciousness feedback, recorded by a video camera set up in a booth in the back. Over seven days, for a few thousand dollars, they record about 750 videos. 

You get two texts when you get back from your vacation. One, from your friend, sharing their research, with a link to a Dropbox folder full of customer interviews. And two, from your bar’s board of directors,[^1] asking for a quick call, [with a link to a Google Meet](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1725736242137182594). 

They don’t fire you though—not yet. Instead, they give you one more chance. Tomorrow morning, they want to see a comprehensive plan for turning the bar around. Show us that you understand what’s not working and you know how to fix it, they say. Otherwise, [we’ll do what we’re here to do](https://reactionwheel.net/2021/11/your-boards-of-directors-is-probably-going-to-fire-you.html).

So here’s the question: If you had a day to save your job, where would you go looking for answers? In your comprehensive database of financial indicators, operational KPIs, customer behaviors, and market trends, where every metric and insight is a query away? Or in 25 straight hours of unedited video interviews?

Two things about this situation seem obvious. First, the actual solution to your bar’s problems *is in the customer interviews*. Your bar probably isn’t failing because of some nuanced secret that’s buried in your inventory logs; your bar is probably failing because customers don’t like it. And you’re much more likely to find the reasons that they don’t like it by [listening to 750 people](https://wraptext.equals.com/how-to-ship-fast/#:~:text=If%20what%E2%80%99s%20Important%20is%20not%20obvious%20you%20are%20not%20close%20enough%20to%20your%20customers.) tell you why they don’t like it than you are by spelunking through in a database of quantitative behavioral exhaust. 

And second, despite that, you’d probably use the data, not the interviews. You have 24 hours! There are 25 hours of videos! You only have time to watch a few! You would be insane—and your board would be insane not to fire you—if you proposed a bunch of changes based on a handful of randomly selected snippets of feedback.[^2] Important boardroom presentations should be full of [charts and scientific analysis](https://www.ft.com/content/bd54bbdf-e9f2-48a9-ac65-a03743df275a), not haphazardly extrapolated pull quotes. 

In countless ways, both explicit and implicit, this is the lesson we’ve been taught about business decision-making: Quantitative rigor beats qualitative estimation. We hear this so much that it’s easy for this axiom to blend into another one: Data is objective, and words are anecdotes and hearsay. Databricks deals in facts; Dropbox videos deal in feelings. “Without data,” [the saying goes](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7327935-without-data-you-re-just-another-person-with-an-opinion), “you're just another person with an opinion.”

But I’m not sure that that belief—that data is the capital-T Truth—is actually why we’ve come to rely on quantitative over qualitative information. Suppose, for instance, that instead of interviewing 750 people, your friend *surveyed* 750 people. Each person answered a couple dozen multiple-choice questions about themselves and their feelings about the bar. They rated your drinks on a Likert scale; they chose, from a list of possible options, the main reasons they wouldn’t recommend it to a friend. This information—this data, just as “untruthful” as the interviews, but quantified and structured—would almost certainly be included in your board presentation. 

Why? Not because it’s more accurate than the interviews, but *because it can be aggregated.* Each survey response is just as anecdotal as an interview; the difference is that data can quickly be combined into averaged and summarized forms. 

That, I think, is actually what makes data powerful. We can perform mathematical operations on it. A billion data points can be collapsed into a one measure that blends every individual number into a single composite. Statisticians don’t manually study each record, pull out a few representative ones, and present them as an approximation of the world.[^3] No, they average them, in a way that the opinion of every data point is incorporated precisely in accordance with its importance.

The only way we can describe an entire corpus of videos is by pulling out a few examples—which is imprecise—or by having a researcher meticulously study and summarize them—which is expensive, slow, and subject to the whims, skills, biases, and memory of the researcher. Though the raw material in that Dropbox file is probably more valuable than the raw material in your Databricks database, we can’t easily mine or manipulate it; we can only sample it. That’s why we instinctively dismiss this sort of information as untrustworthy or biased: Not because it’s wrong, but because there’s no way to look at all of it at once. 

In other words, data hasn’t been put on a corporate pedestal because its contents are more valuable than the contents of customer interviews, or support tickets, or online reviews. It’s been put there because, unlike qualitative observations, which can only be seen one at a time, data can be [summed into an elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant).

# Breaking: Oil companies oversell oil

In this sense, the data industry is an industry built on convenience. Companies have two collections of information—quantitative versus qualitative; numbers versus words; structured versus unstructured. Both are valuable, but only one of those collections is easy to manipulate and aggregate. To warp the analogy about [data being oil](https://blogs.oracle.com/saas/post/data-is-the-new-oil-how-emerging-tech-makes-data-more-accessible-amp-valuable), quantitative data is *accessible* oil. Qualitative data has the same potential energy, but is buried deeper in the earth, and requires more advanced technology to refine. So, we built an industry designed to extract the stuff that we can use. And just as energy companies became *oil *companies, companies in the business of providing insight and intelligence became *data* companies. 

Initially, the focus made sense. Companies should carefully track what they sell, measure how efficiently they operate, and look for useful patterns in the digital footprints of their customers. If you were trying to fix a bar, foundational financial data about how much money the bar makes and loses probably is more important than a bunch of customer interviews. Without those numbers, you wouldn’t even know it was failing, much less how to fix it. 

As we’ve gotten better at this basic stuff, the data industry—which has spent years promoting the importance of [data-driven cultures](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/how-to-build-a-data-driven-organization), and commissioning studies to show that data-driven companies [are more profitable](https://cloud.google.com/blog/transform/data-leaders-more-profitable-innovative-hbr-data)—has been forced to come up with more creative ways to wring meaning from our raw material. We’ve sold people on the idea that they need more data; that they need it to be faster and updated more often; that they need to summarize and analyze it with increasingly exotic math. 

But this has diminishing returns. Could you fix the bar with hourly precipitation records, or a complex causal model that correlates demographic data with purchasing behavior, or a [multidimensional real-time pricing engine](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-much-for-that-dag-in-the-window#:~:text=Ever%20the%20cradle%20of%20innovation%2C%20Frisco%E2%80%99s%20won%E2%80%99t%20simply%20charge%20a%20flat%20price%20for%20their%20drinks.)? Maybe? Probably not?[^4] But even if you could, it would take a lot of energy, money, and expertise.[^5] [From this blog a year ago](https://benn.substack.com/p/day-of-reckoning), another oil analogy:

> The data of a mid-sized B2B SaaS product simply doesn’t have the potential energy of Google’s search histories, or of an Amazon’s browsing logs. If the latter examples are the new oil, the former is a new peat bog. No matter how good the tools are that clean and analyze it, how skilled the engineers are who are working on it, or how mature the culture is around it, it’ll never burn as [hot or as bright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density)… 
> [W]e assume that there are diamonds buried in our rough data, if only we clean it properly, analyze it effectively, or stuff it through the right YC startup's new tool. 
> But what if there aren’t? Or what if they’re buried so deep that they’re impractical to extract? What if some data, no matter how clean and complete it is, just isn’t valuable to the business that owns it?

Put differently, though data has clear value, at some point, we’re either scraping the bottom of the barrel for residue, or filling it up with diluted, low-octane backwash. That’s not to say there isn’t any energy left in there, but the effort-to-extracted-value curve is logarithmic. The work won’t always be worth it. 

Last year, I thought the solution to this problem was to do simpler things: 

> I think we have to be more targeted in our ambitions, as both data teams and as data vendors. Focus on proven tooling and use cases—reporting, dare I say decision support—over moonshots. Focus on identifying which few datasets have real value, rather than assuming it’s all of them. 

I’m not sure this is right anymore. Instead, what if we went looking for a better reservoir?

# Microsoft Wordcel

This query is fake:

But it’s not *entirely *fake. It’s just not a query that you can run. Instead, it’s a question that an executive might hand to a highly-paid research team, and say, “I want to know what different age groups think of our bar.” Weeks and tens of thousands of dollars later, the research team would come back with a presentation with a few slides that summarized what customers said about the bar, and how those things differed by age.

Then, the executive might say, “Ok but how does it change if we just look at people who like the bar? What about the people who dislike it?” The research team would then go back over the transcripts and their notes, and try to figure out why some people in different age groups liked the bar and why some disliked it. They would, very manually and very slowly, “run” this “query:”

But…what if…we could actually run these queries, quickly, on a computer? What if we could aggregate unstructured, qualitative data in the same way we can aggregate structure, quantitative data? What if there were functions that could summarize text in the same way there are functions that average numbers?

With LLMs, there are? In some rough sense, LLMs train themselves on libraries of text, and then regurgitate an approximate average of what they read. They are an aggregate function for unstructured data, capable of producing a composite view of something that could previously be summarized only through human reasoning and research. 

Could they…go even further, and become a form of statistics, but for text? Summarize two populations of transcripts, and find the main differences between the two groups. Compare the distance between those two groups to the distribution of opinions across the entire population, and figure out if the difference between the two groups’ feedback is “significant.” Do this over time, and see how feedback evolves from month to month. 

Though we take statistics and the ability to perform near-immediate computations on enormous datasets for granted, this wasn’t always possible. There was a point when our methods were basic, and our work had to be done by hand. Is it so hard to imagine that we may one day be able to quickly aggregate and analyze text in a similar way?

# The end of Big Structured Data

Two weeks ago, [Databricks presented a new roadmap](https://www.databricks.com/blog/what-is-a-data-intelligence-platform). In it, they did what data companies always do: Made promises about making data even more valuable. Generative AI, they said, would create a “new wave of unified platforms that deeply understand an organization's data.” Automatically generated metadata and semantic models will keep things organized; text-to-SQL capabilities will make asking questions easy; AI agents will automatically optimize the system’s performance. 

Sure, fine. Perhaps generative AI can make us smarter by keeping our data cleaner for us, by layering some sort of semantic understanding on top of it, and by performing complex combinatorial calculations to find hidden patterns we couldn’t find ourselves. But I think this is the wrong emphasis, a step in a tired direction, and a waste of LLMs’—and Databricks’!—real potential. 

Databricks can warehouse [unstructured data](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/index.html). They can [train](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm) and [fine-tune](https://www.databricks.com/blog/databricks-mosaicml) custom LLMs. They even have an AI-powered [summarize function](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/functions/ai_generate_text.html#examples). Databricks could actually revolutionize what we can do with data, but it won’t come from [flashy marketing](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-end-of-big-data) that promises to extract a few more drops of energy from the oil wells we’ve been mining for decades. It’ll come from pointing AI at a new well—the unstructured video interviews in Dropbox[^6]—and letting us do the basic things with it that we’ve never been able to do before.

[^5]: I mean, sure, a bar is a simple business; to say a bar gets diminishing returns from real-time inventory data isn’t the same as saying Amazon gets diminishing returns from real-time inventory data. Fair.

If any business was both willing and able to spend massive amounts of money to extract every possible penny from data, it would be a hedge fund.

Instead, its portfolio is governed by “a series of if-then rules” that “dealt simply with trends.” For example, “one such if-then rule was that if interest rates declined in a country, then the currency of that country would depreciate, so [Bridgewater] would bet against the currencies of countries with falling interest rates.”

# The modern data stack was never big enough

*Microsoft moves on.*

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Yymj!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc51b7a59-6c30-4504-9430-5c0af14b468e_1500x630.png)
*[There’s always a bigger fish.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8rbkxa7CE)*

Six months ago, the modern data stack hit an important milestone: It was big enough for Microsoft to care about it. Until this year, Microsoft had operated in a different cinematic universe than the classic modern data stack vendors[^1]—in enterprises versus startups, in Houston and Chicago versus Silicon Valley, and in companies that choose software based on its features and cost versus those that choose Notion based on its aesthetic and vibe.[^2] [This May](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/microsoft-launches-fabric-a-new-end-to-end-data-and-analytics-platform/), however, Microsoft stopped ignoring the modern data stack, and decided to fight it:

> Microsoft today launched Microsoft Fabric, a new end-to-end data and analytics platform. ... “Over the last five to 10 years, there has been a pretty massive level of innovation—which is great and that’s awesome because there’s lots of new technologies out there—but it’s also caused a lot of fragmentation of the modern data stack,” Arun Ulag, Microsoft’s corporate VP for Azure Data, told me. ... “When I talk to customers, one of the messages I hear consistently is that they’re tired of paying this integration tax,” he said.
> So Microsoft looked at the core data analytics workloads (data integration, engineering, warehousing, data science, real-time analytics and business intelligence) and looked at how it could build a unified experience around this. … [With Fabric, there’s] “literally just one thing to buy, and it allows customers to save a lot of costs, which, especially in today’s environment, is really important,” said Ulag.

For the modern data stack’s ascendent clique, this was alway the risk. Today’s data tools are famously warehouse-centric; what happens if the warehouse providers decide that they want to build their own versions? Databases make a lot more money than the applications that run on top of them; providers of the latter sell at the pleasure of the former. What if Snowflake gives a [native reporting tool](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/overview/streamlit-in-snowflake/) away to all its customers? Or Databricks [builds](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/05/10/introducing-databricks-workflows.html) (or [buys](https://benn.substack.com/i/114804500/take-the-money-and-dbt-run)) dbt, and provides it for no extra charge? Or Microsoft bundles a [cheaper Fivetran](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/dataflow-support) on top of their Azure SQL databases? Despite what the [inspirational posters](https://www.redbubble.com/i/canvas-print/Gandhi-Portrait-First-they-ignore-you-then-they-laugh-at-you-then-they-fight-you-then-you-win-by-IdeasForArtists/25215911.56DNM?country_code=US&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA1MCrBhAoEiwAC2d64f2BLfSdtyaRoL_Qsv3HOUIooYKMxtFjvoIjx_BI_gs7remAYPEvuhoC4HYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) say, when Microsoft stops ignoring you and starts fighting you, *they *usually win.[^3] 

When it first came out, I thought this was what Fabric was about—the modern data stack [consolidating](https://benn.substack.com/p/case-for-consolidation) around the warehouse at its [center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shortcuts-marketecture-cropped-v2-2048x1035.jpg).[^4] The cash cows were taking control of their loss leaders. [As I said at the time](https://benn.substack.com/p/microsoft-builds-the-bomb#footnote-anchor-7-123990165:~:text=the%20modern%20data%20stack%20may%20not%20get%20steamrolled%2C%20but%20stunted%2C%20frozen%20out%20of%20the%20top%20of%20the%20market%20by%20a%20Microsoft%20sales%20team%20that%20already%20has%20a%20standing%20tee%20time%20with%20every%20enterprise%20CIO.), even if Microsoft didn’t try to directly poach every Astronomer or Hightouch customer, “the modern data stack may not get steamrolled, but stunted, frozen out of the top of the market by a Microsoft sales team that already has a standing tee time with every enterprise CIO." 

That, it turns out, may have been delusional [main-character energy](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/we-all-have-main-character-energy-now). For better or for worse, [Microsoft’s fight’s not with us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OWNspU_yE&t=30s),[^5] but for something much bigger. 

# The Database in Me

If Redshift were to write a [memoir](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Woman-in-Me/Britney-Spears/9781668009048), it would be a weird book. When Amazon launched Redshift in 2012, it was the first affordable cloud-based data warehouse, and an instant success. Practically overnight, [an entire ecosystem of data companies](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/future-of-the-modern-data-stack) formed around it. Segment’s first destination for writing events [was Redshift](https://segment.com/blog/introducing-segment-warehouses-redshift-postgres/); Fivetran’s first users wanted to combine all of their analytics data [in Redshift](https://www.producthunt.com/products/fivetran#fivetran); people ran their businesses [out of Redshift](https://mode.com/blog/funnel-analysis-with-rjmetrics). 

And then, at the height of its fame, Amazon [sold it out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears_conservatorship_case). In the late 2010s, AWS’ sales reps started [getting paid for selling Snowflake too](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/aws-and-snowflake-from-true-competitors-to-frenemies-to-an-alliance-), so long as it was hosted on AWS. Snowflake grew, Redshift faded, and the modern data stack’s first star became a has-been with an interesting backstory and [no future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL-VX3WbA9U). 

A couple years ago, [Erik Bernhardsson wondered](https://erikbern.com/2021/11/30/storm-in-the-stratosphere-how-the-cloud-will-be-reshuffled.html) why Redshift’s parents traded it away. His answer, backed up by research and math and the sort of concrete analysis that this blog prefers not to bother with, was that Amazon probably makes more money—and definitely makes *easier *money—by selling infrastructure to one big vendor like Snowflake than it does by selling databases to thousands of individual buyers like it had to with Redshift. Customers pay Snowflake, Snowflake pays AWS, and “AWS basically ends up with the same bottom line impact, but effectively ‘outsources’ to Snowflake all the cost of building software and selling it. That seems like a good deal for them!”

In the hierarchy of things you want to sell, databases aren’t actually the cash cow, but the [middle fish](https://images.app.goo.gl/7bxRTDsxht2otPAE9)—bigger than the apps, but smaller than the cloud. Just as BI tools and ETL companies sell at the pleasure of database vendors, database vendors sell at the pleasure of the cloud providers. Databricks can undercut the data catalog market by [offering one for free](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog) to its customers—but Google can undercut Databricks by offering big BigQuery[^6] discounts to customers who use GCP. Frank Slootman [comes for data companies](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-an-acquisition-fails#:~:text=Frank%20Slootman%20may%20yet%20come%20for%20us%20all%20too.); Satya Nadella [comes for everyone](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-22/sam-altman-return-to-openai-makes-clear-winners-and-losers-of-debacle). If database vendors want to build durable defenses against their larger predators, eating the modern data stack doesn’t help all that much. They need to prioritize a [higher order bit](https://commoncog.com/highest-order-bit/).[^7] 

# Blue skynet

Easier said than done, though. If companies could just decide to build an [$80-billion-a-year cloud infrastructure business](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/aws-q3-earnings-report-2023.html), AWS wouldn’t be an $80-billion-a-year cloud infrastructure business. But what if you could build a *different* higher order bit, in a [new market](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/blue-sky-thinking) that doesn’t yet have any dominant incumbents? As I said nine months ago, there [might be one out there for the taking](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-public-imagination):

> In ten years, a new type of cloud—a generative one, a commercial Skynet, a public imagination—will undergird nearly every piece of technology we use. … Just as cloud providers built out hundreds of utilities that are all underpinned by core services like EC2, I'd expect OpenAI to do the same thing on top of GPT and other foundational models. …

Assuming this whole AI thing isn’t overblown,[^8] I think this still holds up, with one major adjustment. In that post, I said the public AI providers would sell inference: Developers would send OpenAI a prompt or some sort of media, and OpenAI would send back a response. “Training and running LLMs is very expensive,” I thought, “like building data centers is expensive.” 

The part seems partially wrong. It is expensive, but it’s not *that* expensive. Moreover, [lots](https://erp.today/pwc-joins-the-ai-trend-with-its-own-chatpwc/) [of](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/empowering-associates-creating-better-work-through-new-donna-morris%3FtrackingId=hAeqMlV7TaKr0rUxVIwjCQ%253D%253D/?trackingId=hAeqMlV7TaKr0rUxVIwjCQ%3D%3D) [large](https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/meet-lilli-our-generative-ai-tool) [companies](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2023/09/ey-announces-launch-of-artificial-intelligence-platform-ey-ai-following-us-1-4b-investment) want to train their own models, both to get better results and to maintain control of their data. And the market for that could be huge: Companies are already spending [more than a billion dollars a year](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/10/13/techcheck-openai-on-pace-for-1-point-3-billion-in-2023-revenue-up-4543-percent-from-last-year.html) with OpenAI—despite it being a new technology that most people are just experimenting with, OpenAI serving generic models, and companies having to deal with the security problems associated with sharing data with a third party. 

The real money in AI, then, may not be in foundational model providers who sell inference via API, but in the services that actually look much more like today’s cloud providers—offering metered infrastructure that’s designed to help companies build custom models, fine-tune open source ones, and run both of them.[^9] Moreover, [as those open source models get better](https://twitter.com/abemurray/status/1732723510810759369), the companies best suited to offer this aren’t necessarily those with the most advanced foundational models or the biggest data centers. They’re the companies with access to customers’ data. And nobody has more data than database vendors.

That’s why Databricks paid [such a premium for MosaicML](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/26/databricks-picks-up-mosaicml-an-openai-competitor-for-1-3b/), at a time when it could’ve acquired a number of modern data stack startups [at a discount](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-series-everything-is-fine). MosaicML’s core competency isn’t providing LLMs; it’s *building *them. MosaicML can now [offer services](https://www.databricks.com/blog/what-is-a-data-intelligence-platform#:~:text=Training%20custom%20models%20either%20from%20scratch%20on%20an%20organization%27s%20data%2C%20or%20by%20continued%20pretraining%20of%20existing%20models%20such%20as%20MPT%20and%20Llama%202%2C%20to%20further%20enhance%20AI%20applications%20with%20deep%20understanding%20of%20a%20target%20domain.) for “training custom models either from scratch on an organization's data,” or for “continued pretraining of existing models such as MPT and Llama 2;” Databricks can offer a metered service for running those models. It’s the seed of an AI cloud, if an AI cloud is to be built.

In other words, had Databricks acquired an ETL or BI tool, they’d be a database eating a smaller fish. In MosaicML, they bought what they hope becomes a bigger fish that will one day eat the database. 

# The great fish moved silently through the night water

When Microsoft Fabric came out a couple weeks ago, I was confused by the announcement. The [lede of the press release](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric/blog/2023/11/15/prepare-your-data-for-ai-innovation-with-microsoft-fabric-now-generally-available/) made a bunch of bold claims—“prepare your data for AI innovation;” Fabric is the “biggest launch of a data product from Microsoft since the launch of SQL Server”—but the product seemed more like technical glue between existing services (the [potato](https://benn.substack.com/p/microsoft-builds-the-bomb#:~:text=What%20if%20Microsoft%20built%20a%20potato%3F), if you will). The three customers  that were featured in the announcement didn’t talk about AI, but about [governance and security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x8aCEG3FGY), and [data integration and centralization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnFjdMCMbB0).[^10] One [went even further](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4idezKMdw) in his understated enthusiasm:

> Fabric is giving us an evolutionary way to improve what we have. It’s an evolution; not a revolution. … Those capabilities were always there in Azure, but they’ve been brought together under one roof in Fabric.

Nothing is wrong with any of this, especially for Microsoft, who sells to [systems integrators](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industrysolutions/partner) as much as they do to end customers. A unified platform designed to help consultants integrate all the Microsoft services they’re hired to deploy and manage is surely part of what Fabric is about. Still, none of this matches the headline.[^11] 

It’s possible that the glitter about AI is just branding, [chasing the trends that people are searching for](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=ai,a%20single%20unified%20software%20as%20a%20service%20platform%20for%20analytics%20services%20on%20our%20data%20estate&hl=en). But I think that’s too cynical. I’d guess Fabric is actually about the same thing that Databricks’ acquisition of MosaicML is about—putting in the studs for what might become the next multi-hundred billion dollar market. Not only does Microsoft already have data in Azure, but they also have access to [unstructured data](https://benn.substack.com/p/avg-text) in Office, Outlook, and Teams. The real vision behind Fabric isn’t to be the data platform that sits underneath some charts in PowerBI; it’s to the infrastructure that collects and manages the data that can be fed into an [AI model factory](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-ai-platform-blog/driving-ai-innovation-across-digital-landscapes-azure-ai-and/ba-p/3978686).

Of course, Microsoft and Databricks aren’t the only players here. OpenAI—now free to make money with wild abandon—will probably [play along](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts). Snowflake surely has something in the works. AWS launched Q, which is something between a [powerful AI assistant that can solve problems and spark innovation](https://aws.amazon.com/q/), and a chatbot that is [also confused](https://www.platformer.news/p/amazons-q-has-severe-hallucinations) by AWS documentation. Google is armed with [incredible technology](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction), access to Gmail and Google Docs, and a [chronic habit of underplaying good hands](https://benn.substack.com/i/58708482/google-is-wasting-all-the-good-cards). IBM and Oracle will probably [show up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipsPgNEmAXI).  

Though the fight hasn’t started yet—we still have to figure out if AI is useful, after all—the big companies are [quietly maneuvering into position](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/484588-the-great-fish-moved-silently-through-the-night-water). Announcements like Fabric and acquisitions like MosaicML give us a peek of what they’re building. And if it doesn’t want to get passed by—or outright eaten—the modern data stack is [gonna need a bigger boat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I91DJZKRxs).

[^1]: What is the “classic” modern data stack? A contradiction, probably, but most people know what I mean?

[^2]: I’m not saying that trendy and well-designed tools aren’t useful. But I am saying that a lot of people buy trendy and well-designed tools because they [want to be seen](https://twitter.com/hardmaru/status/1726212511412933097) as people who use trendy and well-designed tools. Silicon Valley isn’t above [status symbols](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/10/how-loro-piana-became-silicon-valleys-favorite-flex.html).

[^3]: Ask Slack [how the attention went](https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad).

[^4]: I don’t understand what this diagram means, but “OneLake” is definitely written in the biggest font.

[^5]: On one hand, this clip is backwards? If the analogy worked, the modern data stack would be band-of-misfits Johnny Ringo, Microsoft would be living-legend Doc Holliday, and *Ringo* would be trying to fight *Holliday*. And then *Holliday* would say, “The fight’s not with you, Ringo,” and they would both just walk away. On the other hand, it’s a great scene, so why overthink it?

[^6]: If you write long and peculiar SQL statements in GCP’s cloud data warehouse to analyze the performance of other long SQL statements in that same warehouse, you get to say “big queer BigQuery queries query big queries.”

[^7]: This is a good post and you should just read it, but to quickly summarize: “The binary representation of a number is made up of a set of ordered bits. The number 13 would be represented as 1101. The increase in value of flipping a higher-order bit outweighs flipping all the lower-order bits combined. 100 is bigger than 011, 1000 is bigger than 0111, and so on.” Very, *very* roughly, the tech market is made up of three ordered bits—one for cloud computing, one for databases, and one for apps. If you’re a database provider—and therefore represented by 010—building a bunch of apps can bump your number up to 011. That’s a little higher than 010, but much smaller than both 110 and 100. Which is all a very nerdy way of saying no matter how many apps a database vendor builds, they’ll always be a much smaller fish than a cloud provider.

[^8]: It might be? For comparison, Apple launched the App Store in 2008. Three of the [most popular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(Apple)#Of_all_time) iOS-native apps of all time are [Facebook Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_(software)), [Instagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram), and [WhatsApp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp), which came out in 2011, 2010, and 2009, so it took about two years for people to build transformative applications on top of the platform. We’re about one year into the LLM hype wave, Microsoft Copilot [might be the only truly notable product](https://www.latent.space/p/bryan-bischof#:~:text=I%20got%20a%20text%20message%20from%20a%20VC%20earlier%20today%2C%20and,more%20blown%20away%20by%20other%20AI%20integrations.%20And%20I%27m%20not%20yet.) that’s been built on one so far.

[^9]: Importantly, helping people train models with millions of parameters isn’t cool; *running* those models billions of times—and charging for compute every time—[is cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e0n7vTLz1U).

[^10]: So the *content *of these customer interviews is a bit underwhelming. But the *existence* of them is why Microsoft [is an army](https://benn.substack.com/i/53744915/the-idealist-versus-the-army) you can never bet against. According to the launch post—i.e., the post that marks the beginning of Fabric being generally available—“25,000 companies are already using Fabric today, including 67 percent of the Fortune 500.” I’m sure that’s inflated by a bunch of Azure customers automatically having Fabric turned on for them, but still, that is a flex.

[^11]: Or the amount of thrill in this [companion launch post](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/empower-power-bi-users-with-microsoft-fabric-and-copilot/).

# Playing for ourselves

*A review, of sorts, of "Who Makes the NBA?," and what it means for the rest of us.*

![Jusuf Nurkic: Draymond Green needs help, glad he didn't 'choke me'](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H1pn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06566c12-8cfa-46e1-9fda-23576ad058bc_1024x682.jpeg)
*[Draymond Green](https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/1734796486150369579)*

Google came out when I was in middle school. We were taught how to use it in “Computer Lab,” a once-a-week class in which we mostly learned about Microsoft Office, struggled with *[Touch Typing for Beginners](https://archive.org/details/ttb-20)* and *[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL-13NZAXuE)*, and tried not to get caught playing [Jippii mini golf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp4iL9WKpV4). 

The world wide web was coming, our teachers said, and search engines were going to be an important tool for navigating the information superhighway. To make the most of Google and Yahoo, we needed to learn about [“advanced” search techniques](https://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/gsasearch/search_tips.jsp), using logical operators, range searches, and prefixes like “site:” that would refine our results. These were going to be the critical skills for the information age; learn them, or get left behind.

The [fear mongering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Abuse_Resistance_Education) turned out to be half right. Being proficient with Google is clearly an important skill—far more important than my teachers probably anticipated. It’s difficult to imagine being able to function in today’s world, much less in its job market, without having a fair bit of intuition about how to use Google. “Let me Google that for you” was [funny in 2008](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/let-me-google-that-for-you-shows-luddite-friends-how-to-search/); now, it’d be genuinely alarming. 

But that expected proficiency has nothing to do with the cheat sheets of boolean operators we were given in 2000. People who are [good](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/12/pete-buttigieg-wikipedia-page-editor.html) at [Googling](https://gizmodo.com/this-is-almost-certainly-james-comey-s-twitter-account-1793843641)[^1] aren’t good because they know that you search for keywords in URLs by using the “allinurl:” prefix; they’re good because they have an instinct for how Google works. They know its quirks, and how to take advantage of them. They are like F1 drivers—their ability doesn’t come from reading the manual, but from having a feel for the machine.

We are having the same moment with AI. Twitter narcissists,[^2] LinkedIn influencers,[^3] and VCs[^4] are warning us that we need to [evolve or die](https://www.amazon.com/Evolve-Die-Seven-Rethink-Business/dp/0470593458). Hundreds of vendors are predicting futures in which everyone needs to buy what they’re selling. And out-of-touch bloggers are soapboxing about [what it all means](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-rapture-and-the-reckoning), and [how our jobs and lives will change](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-analysis-dies) because of it. 

Among this sea of Nineties’ middle school teachers, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz is from the future.

Earlier this week, Stephens-Davidowitz published his [third book](https://www.amazon.com/Who-Makes-NBA-Data-Driven-Basketballs-ebook/dp/B0CPW4VN28), *Who Makes the NBA?: Data-Driven Answers to Basketball's Biggest Questions.* Like his prior two books, *Who Makes the NBA? *attempts to put numbers to a bunch of interesting questions about how the world actually works. In his [first book](https://www.amazon.com/Everybody-Lies-Internet-About-Really/dp/0062390856), he analyzed Google search data[^5] to figure out what people are really thinking, and if it matches what they say; in his new book, he tried to find patterns that explain who plays in the NBA, and who excels there.

But unlike his prior two books, each of which took about three years to write, *Who Makes the NBA?* was written in thirty days. After playing around with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and [Data Analysis](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8437071-advanced-data-analysis-chatgpt-enterprise-version) (which was [formerly](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8302319-why-can-t-i-see-code-interpreter) known as [Code Interpreter](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#code-interpreter)),[^6] Stephens-Davidowitz didn’t write [a](https://benn.substack.com/p/terror-in-the-skynet) [rambling](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-public-imagination) [blog](https://benn.substack.com/p/large-language-labor-markets) [post](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-truth-is-out-there) [about](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-we-still-need-the-world-wide-web) [what](https://benn.substack.com/p/we-dont-need-another-sql-chatbot) [it](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-smol-analyst) [all](https://benn.substack.com/p/ai-is-coming-for-your-favorite-products) [meant](https://benn.substack.com/p/tribal-accelerationism), or [talk](https://benn.substack.com/p/microsoft-builds-the-bomb) [about](https://benn.substack.com/p/avg-text) [the](https://benn.substack.com/p/gsnowflake) [tools](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-modern-data-stack-was-never-big-enough); he stepped into the arena. Given how quickly he found he could clean, munge, and analyze data with ChatGPT, he gave himself a challenge: Use it to [write a book in thirty days](https://twitter.com/SethS_D/status/1722399985709318368). 

He did, kinda. The book is brief—it’s a breezy two-hour read, about a third of which is an appendix about his AI-powered research process.[^7] Reading *Who Makes the NBA?* felt less like reading a book, and more like reading a loose collection of FiveThirtyEight (RIP) and Deadspin (RIP) blog posts.[^8] 

But for those of us who work in data, that’s exactly what makes the book worth paying close attention to (and paying for; it’s ten dollars; [go buy it](https://www.amazon.com/Who-Makes-NBA-Data-Driven-Basketballs-ebook/dp/B0CPW4VN28)). Instead of working like a novelist or an academic to write *Who Makes the NBA?*, Stephens-Davidowitz worked like one of us: Against a tight deadline, worried more about directional correctness than scientific rigor, and responsible for not just producing his analysis but also presenting it. Every chapter of *Who Makes the NBA? *is roughly the same as a report we might deliver on some strategic corporate question. If we want to understand what our jobs might look like in several years, *Who Makes the NBA? *is the best answer we have yet. 

# The practical section on what we all need to learn

The biggest conclusion—for better or for worse, I suppose—is that AI is a long way from replacing us. When instructing ChatGPT to do its works, Stephens-Davidowitz found that “clarity and precision are paramount” and “any ambiguity can lead to unintended consequences.” This suggests that, at least when doing open-ended analysis on new datasets,[^9] it’s important to be analytically fluent. ChatGPT can port the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) from R to [English](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1617979122625712128)—but it still needs to be talked to using the vocabulary of the Tidyverse.

Furthermore, Stephens-Davidowitz said that ChatGPT struggled with mildly complex analyses, and was loose in its statistical computations: “Handling more complex aspects of regressions, such as dealing with standard errors, may not be as robust.” 

None of this is terribly surprising; these sorts of shortcomings are well-documented at this point. As I [wrote earlier this year](https://benn.substack.com/p/we-dont-need-another-sql-chatbot#%C2%A7we-can-be-good-or-we-can-have-fun)—and as Andrej Karpahty, one of OpenAI’s leading researchers, said [in a recent tweet](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1733299213503787018)—the randomness inherent in LLMs make them undisciplined order-takers. Instead, I though, we should treat them like creative but unruly prima donnas: 

> One of the most striking things about LLMs is that they’re much better at the creative parts of analysis than they are at the mechanical parts. Ask ChatGPT to write a SQL query against an artificially simple schema; it’s a junior analyst, at best. But ask it to come up with possible hypotheses to explain why there’s some anomaly in a metric, and it does better than I would. …
> I’m not sure that I want to say that all the query-writing chatbots should pivot into analytical reasoning bots. [That’s the job I want](https://benn.substack.com/p/insight-industrial-complex#:~:text=I%20still%20remember,wait%20a%20minute%E2%80%A6%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D), to be at the top of the creative food chain with an army of machines doing the mundane tedium below me. But the army we’re building—creative, unpredictable, and equally prone to both novel ideas and lies—is becoming [more man than machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNCxbM50eWQ). If we’re looking for chatbots that make us all better at working with data, without having to rebuild an entire BI tool in the process, our best option may be to let them do the job *we* wanted to do all along.

Not yet, apparently. In an interview, Stephens-Davidowitz [was asked](https://www.youtube.com/live/UQqQQUMHnmw?si=Z9pIlTmaWPwWNboH&t=3433) about exactly this. Did he ever use ChatGPT “as a collaborator to help drive his own hypothesis formation?” He said he tried, but it never worked. 

For example, he gave ChatGPT a list of countries and the number of NBA players they produced per capita, and asked it to tell him what the countries at the top of the list have in common. It said nothing useful. ChatGPT’s “current capabilities in correlating [its] extensive knowledge to generate new theories or uncover complex patterns were limited.” Moreover, one of the book’s most interesting findings—that most seven-footers in the NBA aren’t particularly gifted athletes—[was recommended by one of Stephens-Davidowitz’s Twitter followers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQqQQUMHnmw&t=374s), not ChatGPT.

In the end, most of the value that Stephens-Davidowitz got from ChatGPT was in accelerating the mundane and tedious tasks of cleaning and blending data, and in quickly cycling through dozens of regressions and pivots of those datasets. It wasn’t a second brain; it was several dozen extra pairs of hands. [From another interview](https://youtu.be/7Y1CGY29bXw?si=l9N5rviAWT7aGMCP&t=222):

> AI, for me, just eliminates all the parts of my job or work process that I hate. I hate cleaning datasets, merging datasets. … It does all of that for you and frees you to be creative and ask the questions. 

Stephens-Davidowitz did find at least one novel application though. In trying to determine the relationship between the difficulty of a player’s upbringing and their performance in the NBA, he asked ChatGPT to “objectively rate the childhood difficulty of each NBA player on a scale from 1 to 10.” Notably, he didn’t provide any biographical data to ChatGPT to do this; he just asked it to use what it already knew about the players. Though that feels like a particularly fraught issue to score in this way—players’ biographies come from sources like Wikipedia, and those pages are surely biased in all sorts of ways—it partially confirms that LLMs can almost be treated like a [database of unstructured text](https://benn.substack.com/p/avg-text) that can be summarized, queried, and manipulated directly. 

So what do all of us need to learn? The answer, it seems, is nothing in particular. We just need to start using tools like ChatGPT, and, as we all did with Google, develop an intuition for how they work. Though Stephens-Davidowitz lists a number of specific tips and tricks in the book’s appendix, he ultimately concluded that the best way to make the most of ChatGPT is just to “[practice with it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQqQQUMHnmw&t=1961s)”

# The blustery section on What It All Means

Practice enough, and you can write a book in thirty days. But can you write a *good* book? This is where things get weird. 

My initial answer is, not really? The analytical substance of *Who Makes the NBA? *felt rushed and incomplete. Stephens-Davidowitz posed a number of questions, offered some circumstantial answers, and quickly moved on to the next topic. Its conclusions feel more like curious gimmicks than actual results, and I came away sometimes skeptical and rarely satisfied.[^10] None of this was true for *Everybody Lies*; after reading that book, I felt convinced of most of what Stephens-Davidowitz had said. 

But if I’m honest with myself, that certainty didn’t come from his analytical arguments; it came from the context around them. I read *Everybody Lies *in a hardcover, with an imprint from HarperCollins and a foreword by a [prominent academic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker).[^11] The book’s arguments were neatly tied together in a crisp narrative. It had impressive testimonials, had been featured [on various morning shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6BAxwopriI), and was a *New York Times* bestseller. 

*Who Makes the NBA?*, by contrast, was self-published hours after its completion. The book was short; its narrative was clunky; its charts were visually mismatched. When I bought it, the only customer review was [from Stephens-Davidowitz’s mom](https://twitter.com/SethS_D/status/1734334094266490972).[^12] 

Obviously, these differences are to be expected, when one book was written over three years and one was an experiment written in thirty days. My point here is not to criticize *Who Makes the NBA?*; my point is that analytical work *is very hard to judge on its merits alone*. 

Give us a chart with a startling conclusion, and we don’t judge it based on the math that’s underneath it; we judge it based on [how compelling the story is around it](https://benn.substack.com/i/89635026/data-on-trial). We judge it based on how others seem to be judging it. We judge it based on the anecdotes and personal experiences that confirm it. 

More subtlety, we also judge it based on effort that went into creating it, and what I’ve previously called “[foundational legitimacy](https://benn.substack.com/i/89635026/foundational-legitimacy).” Stephens-Davidowitz spent three years writing *Everybody Lies*; I assumed its conclusions must’ve been rigorously tested. And Stephens-Davidowitz, as a human being and not an all-powerful supercomputer that can find correlations on command, had to develop his theories and find evidence to support them on his own. As I said a year ago, “yes, we can [torture data to make it say anything](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/if_you_torture_the_data_long_enough,_it_will_confess_to_anything)—but making it confess a lie takes a lot more effort than getting it to tell the truth.” 

That’s what’s most jarring about reading *Who Makes the NBA?*—it break both of these assumptions too. People have spent lifetimes looking for better ways to measure the talent of NBA players, and for hidden signals that predict which draft prospects will become All-Stars. After thirty days of work, in a book that was set to be published before any of its discoveries had been made, Stephens-Davidowitz proposed new and novel answers. 

Are they right? It would be kind of wild if they were! But they might be! I don’t know! And without looking for external signals, I don’t know *how* to know!

Of course, it doesn’t matter if I ever know; no NBA team is asking me to rank their draft boards. But as I mentioned before, the work in *Who Makes the NBA?* is pretty similar to the sort of work that analysts create inside of companies, and people do ask me to create or assess that work. Though I like to think that I judge it based on its merits, I probably judge it the same way I judge books like *Who Makes the NBA?*—on how good its narrative is, on how roughly reasonable its math looks, on how much effort I think someone put into hardening it, and on the foundational legitimacy that comes from the fact that the report only exists because someone had to figure out how to put it together.

If *Who Makes the NBA? *is a glimpse into the future, all of this may be going away. Analyses that used to take days and weeks will take minutes and hours. Even if LLMs can’t manufacture our results for us, as they couldn’t for Stephens-Davidowitz, they’ll let us ask far more questions, and help us find more potentially interesting—and potentially spurious—conclusions. And bots will wrap our work with [whatever narrative we tell them too](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-create-narrative?tabs=powerbi-service). How will we judge *that* work? 

It won’t be easy. Case in point: Even Stephens-Davidowitz needed external signals when judging his own work. At one point when he was writing *Who Makes the NBA?*, he created a new metric for measuring coaches, and [found that Warriors’ coach Steve Kerr was more valuable than LeBron James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y1CGY29bXw&t=1806s). The claim went viral on Twitter, people found the unconventional argument unconvincing, and Stephens-Davidowitz changed the metric for the book’s final version. 

Every analyst who’s ever had to work quickly should sympathize with this. If not for other people’s reactions, how do you know if your result is crazy? The numbers add up; the reasoning makes sense. Analysis isn’t an irrefutable science, but a kind of [quantitative logical argument](https://benn.substack.com/p/tilt-and-tilted). Some ideas make more sense than others, but until we test them—assuming we even can—we won’t know if [the rock actually floats or not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LK-99).

In *Who Makes the NBA?,* Stephens-Davidowitz says that NBA players are trapped by bad incentives. On one hand, their pay and popularity is mostly based on how many points they score. On the other hand, their teams’ benefit the most from players who are *efficient* scorers. Taking lots of bad shots is good for players, but bad for teams. 

AI may create the same sort of problem for analysts. As both an analyst and a hack on the internet, I want to find results with clever punchlines. I likely benefit more by saying something startling than I do by saying something that is right. The brilliant analyses that perfectly predict when the sun will rise tomorrow get no press, because it’s expected. The bold and exciting claims get the clicks.

Today, we can only make those claims when we piece them together ourselves. But just as Google made it possible to *find* an argument for anything, I suspect AI will eventually make it possible to *create *an argument for anything. And if people struggle to judge them on their own merits, it will take a lot of discipline for us to promote what we think is right—to play the team sport—rather than what gets attention. 

# The fun section about the NBA

Of course, you don’t have to read *Who Makes the NBA? *so that you can write some tiresome meta-commentary about it; you can also read it because it’s a fun book about the NBA. Despite me sticking these questions in a lazy list at the bottom of this post, these are the topics* *that I’m really here to talk about:

[^1]: For millennials, Googling is the ultimate Dunning-Kruger bait. I’m convinced that if you asked a hundred 33-year olds if they were better than the average person their age at Googling, [ninety](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222465512_Are_We_All_Less_Risky_and_More_Skillful_than_our_Fellow_Drivers) of them would say yes.

[^5]: Stephens-Davidowitz is probably very good at Googling. Not only did he literally write a book about it, but he was also a data scientist at Google.

[^6]: Because using Data Analysis as a noun makes me flinch, I’m going to refer to all of these tools—ChatGPT, Data Analysis, and its former versions of Code Interpreter—as ChatGPT.

[^7]: One very important note: He used ChatGPT for research and analysis, not to write the book’s text. As he said, its writing was too stale and formulaic, on par with a [good eighth grade essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y1CGY29bXw&t=2223s). He did say that ChatGPT proved to be a very capable copy editor, though.

[^8]: To be clear, this isn’t a criticism; this was the point. He was racing to see how far he could go in a set amount of time.

[^9]: As opposed to, say, exploring the pre-defined paths created by a semantic model and a BI tool.

[^10]: To reiterate, this isn’t a criticism of the book, or of Stephens-Davidowitz. The whole point of the experiment was to see what was possible in thirty days, not to see how long it took to write a book as good as *Everybody Lies*.

# The whole scheme

*Alteryx starts playing a new game. Plus, a lie! On Twitter!*

*A man, a plan, a scam – Ponzi!*

*A brief programming note*: This blog will be off next week. Happy holidays; [bah humbug](https://benn.substack.com/p/delirium#footnote-1-45298585).

It's not that startups are Ponzi schemes, but they are pretty Ponzish.

Ten years ago, a friend of mine was offered a job at Optimizely, which was, at that time, a leading A/B testing platform for ecommerce websites. The company was doing well: It had been a standout in its Y Combinator class, and recently [raised $28 million from Benchmark](https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/10/optimizely-series-a/), a top-tier VC firm. It was on pace to bring in more than ten million dollars in annual revenue, and was growing at 400 percent a year. And it had all the glittery intangibles—a new office in downtown San Francisco with space to grow from 70 people to 450; an upcoming [conference](https://www.flickr.com/photos/132000916@N06/17774043473/) with talks from [tech](https://www.flickr.com/photos/132000916@N06/17771910554/) [celebrities](https://www.flickr.com/photos/132000916@N06/17773934823/);[^1] a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Testing-Most-Powerful-Clicks-Customers/dp/1118792416).

Like most startup compensation packages, my friend’s offer included stock options. Those options gave her a claim on equity in Optimizely; that equity gave her a claim on Optimizely’s future profits. In theory, the value of that equity is dependent on Optimizely making money, and distributing that money to its shareholders. 

But no, obviously not. This is not how anyone thinks about startup equity. Nobody—neither employees nor the early-stage VCs who invest in startups—value a startup’s equity by estimating the future dividends that the startup will pay its shareholders and plugging a bunch of numbers into a [Black-Scholes model](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp); they value the equity by guessing how much someone else will pay for it in the future. Their return isn’t funded by the operations of the business; it’s funded by a future investor.

In Silicon Valley startups’ employees and investors, this is the whole scheme: Not to build a business that steadily makes a little bit of money for a long time, but to build a business that someone—another company, a private equity firm, public investors on the stock market—buys [for a lot of money all at once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzAdXyPYKQo). 

All of Silicon Valley is built around this scheme. Venture capitalists exist solely to fund the scheme: They [invest in a company](https://hbr.org/1998/11/how-venture-capital-works#:~:text=The%20idea%20is%20to%20invest%20in%20a%20company%E2%80%99s%20balance%20sheet%20and%20infrastructure%20until%20it%20reaches%20a%20sufficient%20size%20and%20credibility%20so%20that%20it%20can%20be%20sold%20to%20a%20corporation%20or%20so%20that%20the%20institutional%20public%2Dequity%20markets%20can%20step%20in%20and%20provide%20liquidity) “until it reaches a sufficient size and credibility so that it can be sold to a corporation or so that the institutional public-equity markets can step in and provide liquidity.” Most founders start companies to get rich from the scheme; companies like 37signals are notable precisely [because they don’t do the scheme](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/jason-fried-challenges-your-thinking). People say things like “[from idea to IPO](https://foundationcapital.com/credo/#:~:text=founder%20to%20CEO%2C-,from%20idea%20to%20IPO,-%E2%80%94%20is%20why%20Foundation)” because an IPO is when the scheme cashes out; they say “a startup is at least a seven-year commitment” because the scheme [takes about seven years to run](https://www.saastr.com/it-takes-at-least-7-years-in-saas-can-you-do-the-time/). 

And startups hire their employees by promising to let them in on the scheme. Ten years ago, Optimizely was very explicit about this. When my friend got her offer, they didn’t tell her how much her options were worth, like you might when you join a big public company that offers stock grants (usually as RSUs). Instead, they told her how much those options *might* be worth, depending on how well the scheme went. If Optimizely got acquired as a unicorn—the word had just [entered the lexicon](https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/) back then, and [we all](https://mode.com/blog/are-stanford-grads-good-investments/) wanted to use the cool new slang—her shares would be worth $100,000.[^2] If Optimizely became the next Workday, which was recently valued at over $7 billion [after its “breathtaking” IPO](https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/13/workday-ipo-shows-entrepreneurs-what-matters-market-size-profitability-and-yes-pricing/), her shares would be worth $750,000. The comparisons kept going up, all the way to Salesforce, then the biggest SaaS company in the world and valued at $50 billion. My friend’s offer, she was told, would make her more than $5 million.

In 2020, [Optimizely sold to Episerver](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-03/goldman-backed-startup-optimizely-to-be-acquired-by-episerver?embedded-checkout=true), a Swedish technology company, for “less than $600 million.” [According to at least one alleged insider](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24366280), the deal returned nothing to the early employees who joined Optimizely at the time my friend got her offer. The scheme is the whole reason most people are here, but the scheme doesn’t always work.

There are other schemes. People open small businesses—gyms, coffee shops, HVAC repair services—that try to make more money than they spend, and the owners keep what’s left over. Law firms and dental offices create partnerships where senior employees divvy up the company’s annual profits among themselves. Some publicly traded companies attract investors [by paying dividends](https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/what-is-a-dividend-and-how-do-dividend-stocks-work). 

And, as described in an [excellent essay by Cedric Chin](https://commoncog.com/capital-allocation-antidote-to-business-luck/), there is the capital allocator scheme:

> Let’s say that you’re a startup founder. Let’s say that you raised a small seed round and built a B2B SaaS (software as a service, selling to other enterprises) and it turns out — five years into it — that your startup will never hit venture scale. It will *at most* be worth $50 million in valuation; your top-line hits a ceiling of $8M annual recurring revenue (ARR). You think you might be able to get it to $10M ARR, but it’s been two years of stagnant growth now, so you’re not sure.
> This is a common outcome in startupland. You’ve rolled your dice and failed to hit the jackpot. The common outcome is to sell the business, pocket whatever money you make (which may or may not be a life changing amount, to be fair), and then reroll your dice. This presumes that you *may not keep the results of your current roll and roll a new, second die. It presumes you cannot buy the results of other people's rolls. And it presumes that you cannot add the results of new rolls to your current roll.*
> It has always puzzled me that so many people are aware of Buffett’s story but do not then reason about the implications of his actions. Buffett bought Berkshire when *it was a failing textile business in a dying industry*. It had worse than no moat: its death was *guaranteed*.
> Buffett installed a new manager, Ken Chace, atop Berkshire, educated him on ‘return on invested capital’, and told him to harvest (and, if possible, optimise) the cash flows even as the business was in its death throes. Buffett would then use that sputtering source of cash to reinvest into other companies.

For people (like me) who’ve spent most of their careers in Silicon Valley, the idea that employees and investors make money by increasing the value of the company they work for is deeply ingrained in us that it can be [hard to recognize that our scheme is a scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Water). Chin, again:

> It is in the venture industry’s interests that you believe that the only way to a billion dollar outcome is to swing for the fences. It is in their interests to have founders believe that anything less than a venture scale outcome is failure; that they must reset, reroll their dice, and try again for glory. … Consequently, there are many articles about the venture route.

Though people don’t talk about it as much, this capital allocator scheme is also everywhere in Silicon Valley—it’s just not being deployed by startups; it’s being deployed *against *startups. Stagnating early-stage startups that can’t find another VC willing to pay higher price than their last VC get bought for parts and talent; stagnating late-stage startups that people no longer believe will become Workday or Salesforce get bought by private equity firms to be mined for revenue. 

As Chin says, that’s not a bad thing; it’s just not an *exciting* thing: “The compounding takes a long time, the decisions are decidedly unsexy, and there is only so much surplus that gets created as a result of your businesses.” But if you can’t make a bunch of money all at once, making a little bit of money every day is the only other option.

Earlier this year, Alteryx, a publicly-traded data company, approved [their executive team’s compensation packages](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1689923/000114036123016229/ny20006541x2_def14a.htm#tEC). Mark Anderson, Alteryx’s CEO, was offered a total package of $57.1 million. 

That offer, however, was kind of like my friend’s “$5 million offer” from Optimizely—it was built on the promise of the Silicon Valley scheme. Anderson was being paid a base salary of $650,000; he could make another $1.3 million bonus if Alteryx’s revenue growth well exceeded the annual target. The rest of the offer was tied up in performance-based restricted stock units, or PSUs, that would only be awarded to Anderson if Alteryx’s stock price exceeded certain targets. At the time of the offer, Alteryx was trading at about $50 a share; Anderson would be awarded the first tranche of PSUs if the share price rose to $90. To receive all of the available tranches—i.e., for his offer to be worth the $57 million headline[^3]—Alteryx would have to trade above $240.[^4]

Last week, Alteryx agreed to sell itself to Insight Partners and Clearlake Capital Group, two private equity firms, [for $48.25 a share](https://www.alteryx.com/about-us/newsroom/press-release/alteryx-enters-into-definitive-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-clearlake-capital-group-and-insight-partners-for-4-4-billion). The scheme is the whole reason most people are here, but the scheme doesn’t always work.[^5]

—

There are several ways to interpret a deal like this, but here’s one: It’s the end of Alteryx’s run at the Silicon Valley scheme. Prior to the acquisition, Alteryx’s executive team—who all have packages structured like Anderson’s, where relatively moderate bonuses were paid out based on company performance, and relatively huge bonuses were paid out based on stock price performance—was heavily incentivized to focus on how much Alteryx was *worth *over how much money it made. Even the income-statement-based bonus used “[ARR as the sole performance metric](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1689923/000114036123016229/ny20006541x2_def14a.htm#:~:text=ARR%20as%20the%20sole%20performance%20metric),” whereas companies like [Snowflake gated their bonuses](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014722000038/snow-2022proxystatement.htm#:~:text=fiscal%20year%202021.-,Corporate%20Performance%20Goals,-Under%20the%20Cash) on revenue, margins, and other metrics. 

If the acquisition closes, those incentives will change.[^6] According to [Jamin Ball’s latest weekly summary](https://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/clouded-judgement-122123), most of Alteryx’s key financial metrics—revenue, growth rate, gross margins—are all roughly the same as the median public SaaS company, as are its R&D and G&A expenses. In sales and marketing, however, Alteryx spends roughly fifty percent more than the median SaaS company. In part because of this expense, Alteryx loses money every year instead of making it. And in part because of that loss, Alteryx was valued—and in a sense, for sale—at 4.4 times its revenue, compared to a median multiple of 7.2.

If I had to guess, that’s what this deal is all about: Insight and Clearlake saw a $900 million annual revenue stream that they can buy at a relative discount. Slash sales and marketing spend,[^7] flip the annual loss into a profit, and bank the cash for as long as Alteryx’s sticky and slow-moving enterprise customer base holds up. If the business takes off, great; Alteryx could be spun out or sold at a higher price than they paid for it. And if the business stagnates, that’s fine, so long as it’s still making money. For capital allocators, that’s *their* whole scheme.

—

Here’s another, more general way to interpret the Alteryx deal: The Silicon Valley scheme is getting harder to run. Alteryx [has 8,300 customers](https://www.alteryx.com/about-us), makes $900 million a year, and is growing at twenty percent a year. In this market—of higher interest rates, and governed by [more aggressive anti-trust regulation](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2023/Adobe-and-Figma-Mutually-Agree-to-Terminate-Merger-Agreement/default.aspx)—a company with those performance metrics is valuable because of the cash it can make, and not because of what it might eventually be worth. 

That should have reverberations for other tech companies—and for data companies in particular, many of which were built exclusively for the Silicon Valley scheme. Like Alteryx, a lot of these companies will likely find themselves as part of a capital allocator’s scheme instead. The only question is whether they’ll be the [master of their own game](https://twitter.com/lessin/status/1736876974851985632/photo/1), or a [pawn in someone else’s](https://twitter.com/ttunguz/status/1737930179400581410).

# Correction - I lied

I’m not a lawyer, but I assume if I put out a press release that said “I raised a billion dollars from Jeff Bezos to launch [Frisco’s Bar and Grill](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-much-for-that-dag-in-the-window#:~:text=My%20bar%20would%20be%20Frisco%E2%80%99s%2C%20located%20in%20Hayes%20Valley%20in%20San%20Francisco.),” but I had actually raised a thousand dollars from my college roommate, I would get sued for fraud. I also assume that if I put out a press release that said “I raised a billion dollars from Jeff Bezos a thousand dollars from my college roommate to launch Frisco’s Bar and Grill,” I *wouldn’t* get sued for fraud? I mean, I don’t know, but the first one seems like a clear attempt to make money by getting people to come to my restaurant through “[fraudulent representations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1343),” while the second seems like a weird joke? The SEC and Department of Justice probably wouldn’t like the joke, but [they’re reluctant to sue people for jokes](https://www.reuters.com/business/musks-joke-manu-tweet-unlikely-land-him-regulators-red-card-legal-experts-2022-08-17/). Plus, if it was clearly a joke, people would never see my press release anyway. I’m a relative nobody with something like 5,000 followers on Twitter; people—and at some point, the SEC and the Department of Justice—would only read my press release if it said Jeff Bezos invested a billion dollars. Nobody would care if I made a dumb joke. 

But what if I put out a press release that said “I raised a billion dollars from Jeff Bezos to launch Frisco’s Bar and Grill,” and then put a footnote at the end of that sentence that says “jk, it was a $1000 and it was from my old college roommate Mike.” Would *that* be fraud, even if the press release itself says it’s not true? What if that footnote was an *endnote*, and it wasn’t directly attached to the sentence about Jeff Bezos? What if the endnote wasn’t an endnote, but a second press release, issued a day after my first press release went viral, in which I said, “correction, Jeff Bezos was not involved, the investment was led by Mike”? 

I guess I could still argue that these are jokes, but I suspect the SEC and the Department of Justice would eventually disagree. The line between a dumb joke and fraud probably exists somewhere between “Jeff Bezos invested no Mike did” and “now that everyone is talking about Frisco’s, I should admit that I lied about the Jeff Bezos part.”

I’m excited to say that we might get to find out where that line is. Earlier this week, Andrew Young launched a new “AI romance” app—*[Her](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(film))*, as a PG-13 Tamagotchi, basically—[on Twitter](https://twitter.com/andyohlbaum/status/1735786033453863422). In the [second tweet](https://twitter.com/andyohlbaum/status/1735786034783494461) of his announcement thread, he said that “we're grateful to be funded by @naval” (@navel is the handle of Naval Ravikant, one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent investors). Then, after fifteen tweets about all the ways you can customize your Pixar Kelly Kapowski,[^8] Young issued a “correction,” saying, ah, [oops](https://twitter.com/andyohlbaum/status/1736232850285052362), “naval is not involved.”

First, what? And second, is *this* fraud? 

On one hand, definitely? It’s hard to come up with an innocent explanation here. Naval is one of the most famous dozen or so investors in Silicon Valley; he’s not some [two-bit toady](https://benn.substack.com/p/disclose-your-angel-investments) who people forget about being on their cap table. On the other hand, if Young had posted his thread as a blog post, though it’d be pretty weird to say Naval was an investor at the beginning of the post and to say he wasn’t at the end, it doesn’t seem like fraud. And Twitter threads, you could argue, are kind of like blog posts. Even the SEC itself [uses](https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1674469538816045059) [them](https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1712820734177808407) [that](https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1730309863358578741) [way](https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1736779315495186561). 

In other words, *functionally*, Twitter threads are clearly a collection of independent press releases that get shared and read based on their content and their content alone. But *legally*, are they all one document? If they are, incredible. What a loophole. Young—a relative nobody with something like 5,000 followers on Twitter—posted a video; lied about it; people talked about the lie; that helped the thread go viral; Elon Musk [tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1736089942881673560) about it; Naval [tweeted](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1736550978059710470) about [it](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1736235627576987808) several [times](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1736235993441968614); the app [got a bunch of downloads](https://digi.ai/blog/were-just-getting-started); it [shot up](https://twitter.com/andyohlbaum/status/1736461915038380197) the App Store rankings; the video got 22 million views, and the correction only got 300,000. Like, sure, it looks bad to lie, but if you're building some nauseating app so that misogynists can date Lara Croft, how worried are you about having an honest brand anyway?

[^2]: I have no idea what the actual number was; $100,000 is made up.

[^3]: Even this number is too low, actually. This is the accounting cost of the package at the time it was awarded, when Alteryx’s equity was valued at about $50 a share. If Alteryx’s stock rose to $240, Anderson would be awarded 1.5 million shares, which would be worth $360 million.

[^4]: These sorts of compensation packages aren’t uncommon—it’s how Elon Musk [became the richest man in the world](https://www.axios.com/2022/11/16/elon-musk-compensation-package)—but having such a large percentage of the potential payout gated on the stock price alone is unusual.

[^5]: I mean, the scheme didn’t work perfectly for Alteryx’s leadership team, because Alteryx sold for well short of $240 a share. But it definitely worked. Just [from the shares they already own](https://www.alteryx.com/about-us/newsroom/press-release/alteryx-enters-into-definitive-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-clearlake-capital-group-and-insight-partners-for-4-4-billion#:~:text=Beneficial%20Ownership%20as%20of%20December%2015%2C%202023), Anderson will make $7 million for the acquisition, Alteryx’s [series B investor](https://investor.alteryx.com/governance/board-of-directors/person-details/default.aspx?ItemId=e901e0cf-ca47-42d6-8651-53aca29a96b2) will make $50 million, and [Alteryx’s founder](https://investor.alteryx.com/governance/board-of-directors/person-details/default.aspx) will make $350 million.

[^6]: From an [internal FAQ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1689923/000119312523297686/d783247ddefa14a.htm) about the acquisition: “At the closing, any RSU that is subject to performance-based vesting and that has not become eligible for vesting based on the actual or deemed achievement of the performance metrics of the RSU (including any such achievement in connection with the closing) will be cancelled and will not receive a payment.”

[^7]: The [internal FAQ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1689923/000119312523297686/d783247ddefa14a.htm) also includes a cryptic, one-sentence response to a question about potential workforce reductions: “We will continue to adapt the organization as needed to align with industry and business trends.”
