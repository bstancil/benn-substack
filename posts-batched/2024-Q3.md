![The Truman Show (1998) - IMDb](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wxLk!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Febc7dce5-efcb-4047-a2b7-5e4269ad7895_2048x1371.jpeg)
*[Join his social network.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U4-KZSoe6g)*

Here’s something I’ve wondered for a while: If you became famous on a social network that was full of bots that were programmed to treat you like an A-list celebrity, would you use it?  

Like, you post a single emoji and a selfie on Truman, the new social network from Meta that looks indistinguishable from Twitter or Threads. It gets [three million likes](https://x.com/BTS_twt/status/1353536893787357184). Not artificially, where the like counter goes up on its own; three million different bots, who are also interacting with each other, actually click the like button. You post a dumb joke; it’s [shared 800,000 times](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1519480761749016577). You [wade into politics](https://x.com/charli_xcx/status/1815182384066707861); everyone starts talking about what you said; important people are debating each other in your replies. Someone makes a remix of your post; [four million people watch it](https://x.com/ryanlong03/status/1808510079382982870). Your posts become memes; trends; hashtags; a verb. You get thousands of new followers, every day. People start mentioning you in conversations that you aren’t a part of; they want your opinions; they wonder what you think; they develop a parasocial relationship with you. Cute people slide into your DMs. Truman is an entire world’s water cooler; everyone is there; it is as sprawling and endless as Twitter—trillions of interactions, billions of people, [eight million stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6014HuxcE&t=105s)—but here, you are one of its [main characters](https://x.com/maplecocaine/status/1080665226410889217). When Buffett speaks, [the market reacts](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2017/02/16/buffett-effect-buy-what-he-buys/97965132/). When Kendrick drops, [we dissect every lyric](https://www.tiktok.com/@doloayers/video/7392248632436690218). And when you speak, legions of avatars like and respond.[^1]

But none of it is “real.” There are no human beings on the other side of your screen. When you log out of Truman and step into some other world—into your living room with your family; out at an actual, physical coffee shop or bar; on other social networks, populated by an entirely different set of accounts—nothing crosses the chasm. What happens in your Truman stays on your Truman, and what happens in everyone else’s Truman stays in theirs.

If you could join that social network—that matrix, in which [you’re rich, someone important, like an actor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wgn0KlSHl4&t=54s)—would you? Would you post on it? Would you feel good when the bots liked what you said?

What if every other bot on Truman was its own unique AI agent? What if there were a billion of them, interacting with each other, having millions of conversations about things that aren’t you, and you were one of a few hundred popular accounts that they followed? What if they were all trained to have their own personalities? What if each of them was designed to mimic the personality of a real person, and to act like that person acted? What if it wasn't a simulation of a social network, but a simulation of an entire world, as seen through a social network?

What if the AI agents weren’t explicitly told to like you or your posts, and were instead just instructed to *read* them, and respond in whatever way the human that they represented would? What if Truman only gave you an audience—millions of engaged followers—but you had to earn their admiration?

What if there was only one Truman network? What if Meta could only afford to run one billion-bot social network, and you won a special lottery to be the only person at the center of it? What if your popularity on Truman was unique, because you were the only person in the world who was on Truman?

What if other people could join your Truman network? What if it was populated by AI agents that followed you, but it was also populated by real people who followed you too? What if you couldn’t tell how many of each there were, and you didn’t know who was who? [What if the bots were dogs?](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-most-reprinted-new-yorker-cartoon-breaks-record-at-auction-for-a-single-panel-comic-180983135/)

What if there were no bots at all, and Truman was instead full of people who were *paid* to read your posts? What if you weren’t interacting with AI agents that were programmed with code, but with people who had been programmed with money? 

What if the people weren’t actually paid, but felt *professionally obligated* to like your posts? What if their core directive was commercial *quid pro quo*? What if Truman was an insular game of artificial influence, powered by an unspoken understanding that the whole thing is a ouroboros, a circular reference error, a corporate Klein bottle of content, a place where people promoted everyone else’s posts in hopes that it would somehow help promote theirs? What if the people on Truman were real, but their motivations were manufactured? 

What if Truman wasn't named after a [fake character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlnmQbPGuls) who lived at the center of a fake world, but was instead called something more plausibly genuine, like The Hub, or IndustryIQ, or WorkLife? 

What if it was called LinkedIn? 

# Social-affect capitalism

Ten years ago, LinkedIn, which was bought by Microsoft in 2016, was a résumé and a rolodex.[^2] It was a career fair for tryhards, a website that you never logged into unless you were either looking for a job, looking to fill a job, or looking up how old someone was.[^3] Now, it’s a true social network, for work. There are feeds; there are posts; there are likes and followers and influencers. And while [Microsoft shares very little](https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/index.html#:~:text=All%20up%2C%20LinkedIn%E2%80%99s%20revenue%20surpassed%20%2415%20billion%20for%20the%20first%20time%20this%20fiscal%20year%2C%20a%20testament%20to%20how%20mission%20critical%20the%20platform%20has%20become%20to%20help%20more%20than%20950%20million%20members%20connect%2C%20learn%2C%20sell%2C%20and%20get%20hired.) about how many people use LinkedIn, it seems to be having a prolonged moment of popularity. It’s no longer a passive professional portfolio that gets updated once every few years, but a place where people post regularly, and a website—and app!—that we idly scroll through like we used to scroll through Facebook 15 years ago.[^4]

But calling LinkedIn a social network for work probably isn’t specific enough. Work is on other social networks too: TikTok is where we [complain about our work](https://www.tiktok.com/@joshrosen_/video/7358105645918260523); Twitter is where we get in [food fights about our work](https://x.com/anothercohen/status/1816338693575368755). LinkedIn is for…advertising our work? It’s our work lives, oversaturated in [Lo-Fi](https://www.animatron.com/blog/18-best-instagram-filters/#_Toc2043751548). Nearly everything on LinkedIn is either a press release or a corporate blog post for our personal brand: “Official” announcements of job changes; sharing “major news” about our employers’ moves eight pixels to the northeast, and across some contrived equator, on the Gartner Magic Quadrant; [AI-authored appreciation posts](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/30/nx-s1-5056201/google-olympics-ai-ad) for the hardworking team that hosted a webinar; 300-word algorithmically-optimized stories about the best advice we ever got, or a recent moment of gratitude, or some other answer to the question, “[What is your biggest weakness?](https://www.tiktok.com/@hopstair/video/7225192988585102619)” 

On one hand, I get it. There are [950 million wallets](https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/index.html#:~:text=All%20up%2C%20LinkedIn%E2%80%99s%20revenue%20surpassed%20%2415%20billion%20for%20the%20first%20time%20this%20fiscal%20year%2C%20a%20testament%20to%20how%20mission%20critical%20the%20platform%20has%20become%20to%20help%20more%20than%20950%20million%20members%20connect%2C%20learn%2C%20sell%2C%20and%20get%20hired.) on LinkedIn. Many of us want to sell them stuff. If you can get famous on LinkedIn—which you can, mostly by posting on LinkedIn—you can sell them stuff [on easy mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YErOtGMgTNg&t=4258s). Post about something relentlessly enough, and people will eventually buy it. Cringe is a category creator. 

On the other hand, this sort of social-affect capitalism—[commercials, presented like conversations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U4-KZSoe6g)—makes LinkedIn an awfully strange place. Unlike other social media networks, nothing on LinkedIn is spontaneous. No post is just a thought, or the beginning of a genuine discussion. Instead, everything feels planned and scheduled; every interaction is something between politely professional and suspiciously enthusiastic; every message is awkwardly formatted to be maximally viral.[^5] The only two emotions on LinkedIn are bittersweet endings and very exciting beginnings. It’s not socializing; it’s editorial calendar crosstalk.[^6] 

What’s even weirder, however, is how isolated LinkedIn is. It’s a vault, locked on both sides. If something blows up on [Twitter](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/style/khive-kamala-harris-supporters.html) or [TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/14/arts/music/eminem-death-of-slim-shady-gen-z-canceled.html), it crosses over into group chats, into other social networks, into the *New York Times*, on to TV, and into conversations at parties and in people’s homes. Twitter isn’t real life, as they say, but the two [are definitely intertwined](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/opinion/twitter-debates-real-life.html).

But what goes viral on LinkedIn—like [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/morganmacdermaid_i-still-receive-resumes-every-week-that-activity-7208894448435347456-I1o0/), which was [viewed five million times](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7209921423459393538/)—stays on LinkedIn. The only things from LinkedIn that make their way into the broader discourse are posts that are [mocked](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/11/ceo-posts-crying-selfie-on-linkedin-after-laying-off-employees-and-it-goes-viral-.html) for [being](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/linkedin-engagement-proposal-sales-internet-b2538021.html) so LinkedIn.[^7] And there is no reporting on the latest trends on LinkedIn, because there are no trends on LinkedIn. There are no trends on PR Newswire either. 

As rare as it is for things to leak out of LinkedIn, it seems even harder for things to break *into* LinkedIn. Elections, assassination attempts, sports and cultural phenomena—none of it breaches the LinkedIn firewall. The gyre stays tight; the centre holds; no matter what anarchy is loose in the real world, LinkedIn’s posters plow ahead with their regularly scheduled podcasts and anodyne takes. Outside of LinkedIn, we are electrified; on LinkedIn, [we’re pacified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPqDIwWMtxg&t=39s). Pop culture doesn’t exist. Politics don’t exist. The debate about Silicon Valley’s rightward pivot doesn’t exist.[^8] The Olympics don't exist—unless, of course, you can spin them into a way to sell a workshop on [Connected Leadership™](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/communicationexpertspeaker_olympics-leadershipdevelopment-activity-7224400864625487873-h9R9).

Moreover, nobody brings their fame *to* LinkedIn. Global stars monetize their celebrity by selling skincare products on Instagram; they feed their egos by getting attention on Twitter; they sell their souls by marketing their memecoins on TikTok. But who exploits their fame on LinkedIn? If anything, the ultimate status symbol on LinkedIn is not needing to be on LinkedIn. Elon Musk is not there. Jeff Bezos is not there. Tim Cook is not there. Oprah is, and has posted [four times](https://www.linkedin.com/in/owinfrey/recent-activity/all/) in 12 years. LeBron James, Kendrick Lamar, Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Stephen King, Stephen Colbert, Charli XCX, Traci Chapman, Anna Wintour, Magnus Carlson, and Griff[^9] are not there.[^10] 

And that’s perhaps the most damning thing of all about LinkedIn: It’s missing the important people. It’s the happy hour at a corporate conference, but all the speakers and VIPs are at more exclusive events. It’s a hollow networking event for the rest of us; the performative socializing of the riffraff. We grandstand for one another, become “Top Voices” by pumping out platitudes that junior people will think is smart and senior people will agree with, and hope to eventually become rich or famous enough that we’ll one day get airlifted out of LinkedIn and dropped somewhere better. Because how many people *want* to be here? How many people actually use LinkedIn just to talk to other people on LinkedIn?

# Faking for likes and digital hugs

Well, maybe a lot, in a way. Because there might be another way to look at LinkedIn that is a lot more wholesome, and a bit more hopeless.

When I’ve asked people why they use it, the most common answer is that it’s a good sales channel. The second most common answer is that it’s free of the political and social drama that’s typical on sites like Twitter and Instagram, and is a place to talk to professional colleagues in professional tones. In other words, it is a place where *being boring*, at least by social media standards, is still rewarded with likes and comments. 

I can’t help but wonder if that’s also part of the attraction of LinkedIn: It’s a social network where we can all feel popular, even in our khakis and [corporate drawl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFRa7Ovym8s). It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. 

Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and [we are lonely](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/30/opinion/loneliness-epidemic-america.html). 

For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. 

LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.[^11] Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with [likes and digital hugs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPqDIwWMtxg&t=114s), with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,[^12] or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.[^13] And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, [that’s worth something](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/31/character-ai-the-a16z-backed-chatbot-startup-tops-1-7m-installs-in-first-week/).

Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself. In this social network, you have to be an actor too.

[^1]: There are already some [apps](https://theslantedroom.itch.io/idle-influencer) that are like this, though they tend to be more like role-playing games, where you try to become a famous singer or something, rather than being convincing simulations of real social networks. Still, even that is apparently addicting enough to make [some people lose their minds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWpUuRRVKNg).

[^2]: And this [very cool visualization](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/member/product/linkedin-inmaps). I had something like 30 connections when that thing came out, and when I tried to create my graphic, LinkedIn told me it only worked for people with at least 50, which might’ve been the first and last time I had an emotional response to anything I saw on LinkedIn.

[^3]: “Who viewed your profile” [be like](https://www.tiktok.com/@andrewlicout/video/7055028044918082862)

[^4]: Why do I believe this? Vibes. [The yard signs.](https://peggynoonan.com/monday-morning/) I don’t care what the data says; I’ve seen a lot of people on LinkedIn while they’re sitting in a coffee shop at noon on a Wednesday, and there’s no way that those people would be any more likely to use the internet’s job board than anyone else.

[^5]: The old way of writing is dead. People have short attention spans now. Your writing needs to capture them immediately. And keep them on the edge of their seats. When we write, we often try to sound formal and important. But academic studies have found that people lose focus when they have to read complex paragraphs; long words make them tired; they get distracted by arcane punctuation.Are you bored yet?Don’t write paragraphs like that. Write paragraphs like this. Paragraphs that crackle. This is, apparently, how you keep an audience on LinkedIn. With one-sentence, three-emoji paragraphs. 💯🚀💡With paragraphs that sound [like Liz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkAqwHiAR-g&t=1106s)Truss.But mostly, write paragraphs that take up lots of space in a feed. And #DontForget, #Always #HashtagEverything, and @at @mention @a @long @list @of @people @with @big @followings.

[^10]: Tim Duncan [might be](https://x.com/stevekylerNBA/status/760077325140656128)? And Steph Curry is, but for the same reason all of us are: [To sell stuff and promote his podcast appearances.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephencurry30/recent-activity/all/)

[^11]: [Or get bizarrely excited for real.](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-case-for-being-biased?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=%22Oh%2C%20sorry.%20I%20just%20got%20really%20excited%20about%20the%20internet%20of%20things.%22%C2%A0)

[^12]: And man, sometimes they do it in [weird ways](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/linkedin_sales_pitch.png).

[^13]: Is this bad? Probably, but it could be worse. I’d rather us all become friends with salespeople and [dystopian AI-powered tamagotchis](https://x.com/AviSchiffmann/status/1818284595902922884) than turn to some of the [other communities](https://www.amazon.com/Culture-Warlords-Journey-White-Supremacy-ebook/dp/B084FXPHM3) that are often attractive to people who are quietly desperate for social connections (though I’d prefer the third option of [burning down social media](https://benn.substack.com/p/runaway-train), but a fight for a different day). Also, as an aside, that horrifying AI friend company’s website is [friend.com](https://www.friend.com/), but their Instagram handle is [@friend_necklace](https://www.instagram.com/friend_necklace/). It seems possible that Instagram doesn’t let people use [@friend](https://www.instagram.com/friend) as their username, but it makes me wonder: Are premier Instagram handles now more expensive than premier domains? Which costs more, [benn.com](http://benn.com/), or [@benn](https://www.instagram.com/benn)?

# How to create a winning pitch deck

*The title of this post makes it sound like it has a huge potential audience. But its contents are actually pretty niche. *

*[how to buy a winning ax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVTC03NQrs)*

Almost ten years ago, we made this slide for one of our fundraising decks:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!69CC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe239df7-4c41-4c53-8e41-8dde09cfcddd_1600x898.png)

I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous "data professionals,” was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market. I thought it said that even that figure understated our eventual potential, because, once we entered our [more sinister second phase](https://www.theonion.com/starbucks-to-begin-sinister-phase-two-of-operation-1819565956)—selling to the enterprise, [obviously](https://benn.substack.com/p/so-you-want-to-sell-to-the-enterprise)—we would be a company with *$60* billion of economic opportunity. I thought that this slide told investors that we had done our research: We weren’t quixotic dreamers who had become enamored with our own toys and were tilting at technological windmills; we were shrewd capitalists who had been inspired by a hopeful vision for a better future, *and* by the tables in the appendix of the International Data Corporation’s *[Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Software Tracker®](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P23465)*. I thought it said that we had read [the canon](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html#:~:text=Personally%2C%20I%E2%80%99ll%20take%20the%20third%20position%E2%80%94I%E2%80%99ll%20assert%20that%20market%20is%20the%20most%20important%20factor%20in%20a%20startup%E2%80%99s%20success%20or%20failure.), and knew that markets were the most important determinant of a startup’s success. Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers.

In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good:

The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a [notoriously](https://x.com/josh_wills/status/198093512149958656) vague [set](https://yanirseroussi.com/2016/08/04/is-data-scientist-a-useless-job-title/) of [buyers](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram), and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get [drawn and quartered](https://benn.substack.com/p/customer-capture#:~:text=In%20reality%2C%20the%20company%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20get%20to%20those%20features%3B%20it%20gets%20drawn%20and%20quartered.) by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions. 

The slide said that we didn’t know how startups actually work. I thought that it pitched Mode as a clever two-step plan: Analysts, and then everyone else. A wedge, and [then the rest of the ax head](https://www.tiktok.com/@bradley.thor/video/7308190252152245547). But not only were we misplaying that move—“analysts and data scientists” isn’t a sharp blade; [it’s a blunt hammer](https://www.tiktok.com/@bradley.thor/video/7175256765259517230)—those sorts of plans [never really work anyway](https://benn.substack.com/p/trading-places?open=false#%C2%A7carta-again). Step two is a delusion and a distraction.

The slide said that we were naive, and didn’t understand [how hard it is to build enduring businesses](https://benn.substack.com/p/why-are-we-still-surprised-that-startups). It takes years, if not decades, to make a meaningful dent in a market that big.[^1] By the time we were pushing on the boundaries of our $16 billion circle, that market—to say nothing of our early-stage startup and our untested product—would likely have evolved into something else. We were a middle schooler trying to convince our AAU basketball coach to put us on their team by showing them a game plan for [defending the Boston Celtics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AJamTywdsY): We were skipping a whole lot of steps. 

The slide said that we weren’t all that ambitious. On the surface, it seems to—$16 billion! $60 billion! Big numbers![^2] We’re already making plans to play against the Celtics! But what it really says is that we wanted to build a revolutionary product without revolutionizing the market. The most ambitious companies are those that redefine old market boundaries. If we wanted to tell a story about our ambition, showing the size of the current market is just the first chapter. We should’ve also talked about how we expected the market to change, and how we would nudge it along that evolutionary path. That’s the space that the most ambitious companies fill: They don’t have to be category creators in a traditional sense, but they often expand or blur the lines around existing paradigms. Notion, for example, didn’t really create a new category, but blended together parts of Google Docs, to-do lists, internal documentation software, and static website builders. Redshift wasn’t a new category—[like Snowflake](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-end-of-big-data), it started as a simple database that was uniquely fast and cheap and easy to manage—but made analytical databases accessible to companies that couldn’t afford or maintain older generations of products. In cases like these, market maps and Gartner forecasts are the setup. The punchline is how they’re going to change.[^3]

And most of all, the slide said that we hadn’t thought about any of this for very long. Because it was in our pitch for the same reason it’s in everyone else’s fundraising presentation: We Googled "how to make a pitch deck," found the same [Sequoia template](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/sequoia-capital-pitchdecktemplate/46231251#2) that everyone finds,[^4] made a slide called “Market Opportunity” that said something about [TAMs and SAMs and SOMs](https://www.bplans.com/business-planning/how-to-write/market-analysis/tam-sam-som/) and CAGR, and threw as gaudy of a number on it as we could muster.[^5] 

# The initial addressable market

I suppose you could say that that's the point. Pitch decks, one might argue, should follow a numbingly predictable structure—a problem slide with [bewildered customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM4zMofsI7w), this market sizing slide, [two-by-two grids](https://hunterwalk.com/2020/05/25/if-your-pitch-deck-has-a-competitive-2x2-im-going-to-ask-you-this-question/), “a world class team of builders” with little logos of their previous companies under each headshot—for the same reasons resumes should be full of bot-baiting buzzwords: It helps the automatons who read them—VCs, overworked recruiters, and the 24-year olds who are working as frontline filters for both, [Tinder-swiping](https://www.lever.co/solutions/high-volume-hiring/#:~:text=Evaluate%2C%20skip%2C%20advance%2C%20or%20archive%20candidates%20in%20seconds.%20Screen%20and%20evaluate%20candidates%20from%20a%20single%2C%20convenient%20view%20and%20send%20emails%20to%20advanced%20candidates%20without%20ever%20leaving%20the%20screen.%20Lever%E2%80%99s%20Fast%20Resume%20Review%20helps%20your%20team%20hire%20the%20right%20talent%2C%20swiftly%20and%20at%20scale.) through resumes and decks while watching YouTube in the background—quickly scan each document [in 2.3 minutes](https://www.docsend.com/index/pitch-deck-metrics/#h-pdi-metric-2-investor-time-spent).

Which, ok, maybe. Maybe we should write these decks for the pattern-matching AIs that [will inevitably read them](https://pitch.guide/ai-powered-pitch-deck-review). Still, if I were to do it all over again, I would’ve done it differently—if not for the venture associates that were skimming our deck, but for ourselves.

When early-stage startups think about their market, they tend to wonder, as we did, if the global market is big enough for the product they plan to build. Are there enough analysts in the world to sell $100 million worth of SQL editors and charts? ([No.](https://benn.substack.com/p/everything-is-still-bi)) Can a company that hosts online conferences be worth a billion dollars? (Yes, but [not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clubhouse_(app)) for [long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopin_(company)).) These are the markets we research, and the ones we use to convince people of our potential.

But they aren’t the markets that most startups are actually constrained by. Most startups die because the first thing they build—a CRM with one feature, a half-baked forecasting tool for finance teams, a cloud-based [collaborative analytics platform for ad-hoc analysis](https://benn-dot-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/everything-is-bi/mode-helps-analysts.png)—appeals to some tiny idiosyncratic subset of the billion-dollar Gartner blob. That’s the “addressable market” that really matters—not the one that would conceivably buy a product that will likely never exist, but the one that will buy the runt of an MVP that’s currently on the shelf. 

We should’ve run *those* numbers. How big could we get if we sold only to SaaS companies in Silicon Valley between 100 and 500 people that had data teams, were comfortable using cloud software, and would likely be reevaluating their BI tools over the next two years? Are there enough of those buyers that we could find some fraction of them fast enough to prove that the more ambitious thing we wanted to create was worth building? 

Often, if you ask these questions honestly, the answers are troubling. They may tell you that you have to capture 50 percent of your initial market to get to a few million dollars in revenue. That’s bad—but good to know! Because that’s how a lot of startups die: They plan to [make something that people want](https://www.paulgraham.com/good.html#:~:text=became%20our%20motto%3A-,Make%20something%20people%20want.,-We%27ve%20learned%20a), build an incomplete version of it in two years, not many people want *that* thing, and then they run out of money groping around their huge hypothetical TAM for the handful of people who are willing to buy their barren and buggy prototype. But better to know that—and to make a different plan—than to bank on the fantasy of starting with “data workers” and moving to “all workers.”[^6]

# Aim small, miss small

One of the other slides that people say you should put in your pitch deck is your [path to $100 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2015/07/17/every-startups-go-to-market-strategy-has-to-answer-the-100-million-question/) in revenue. I always thought this was another dumb bit of busy work. What’s the point of [extrapolating our five “design partners”](https://xkcd.com/605/) into a financial forecast with 5,000 customers? 

The point, it turns out, wasn’t the projection; it was the plan. It was to force you to explicitly design the type of business you wanted to build. And it was to make you ask what would have to happen for the startup to reach that scale—[“we have to match our best week of signups for 31 straight weeks to be on pace to hit our goal”](https://benn.substack.com/p/playercoachai-investor-update-q1?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=In%20her%20book%20Quit%2C%20Annie%20Duke%20explains%20why%20Stewart%20Butterfield%20shut%20down%20Glitch%2C%20the%20company%20he%20founded%20before%20starting%20Slack)—and to question if those assumptions are remotely plausbile. Any company can hand wave their way to an IPO; it’s much harder to stare down the actual milestones that are required to get you there.

Market sizing is the same exercise, more or less. It can be useless, if you treat it as a mechanical assignment to find a big number in a Forrester report, say “we can sell to five percent of this,” and feel good about your eventual potential. Or it can be helpful, if you use it as a way to figure out—and more importantly, define, for the sake of your own focus—the very narrow market you’ll actually sell to first. 

That’s the only two-step plan that works: Start with some painfully small set of buyers—data teams of a particular type, [college students at Ivy League schools](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/3/1/facebook-expands-beyond-harvard-harvard-students/), cheap startups [who need video conferencing with screen sharing](https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/28/zoom-raises-6m-series-a-launches-version-1-0-of-its-radically-different-virtual-conferencing-tool/)—and expand into the same market but with fewer qualifiers.[^7] And market sizing slides should explain *that *strategy. 

Admittedly, I have no idea if that’s a pitch that VCs will get excited about. But it’s the pitch they *should* get excited about, because it’s a real plan. It shows that the company has thought about how to sell a crude beta and not just an aspirational ambition. And it shows that they know who they can actually sell to. Aim for a big market, and miss big by [building something for nobody](https://benn.substack.com/p/customer-capture). But aim for a small one, and [you might crack it open](https://www.tiktok.com/@bradley.thor/video/7243621094849088811).

Hence this post’s shameful clickbait title—to put a crack in the monopoly of outdated advice that that one deck has over Google’s algorithms.

[^5]: We didn’t even do a good job of that! Surely we could’ve done better than $60 billion. I recently saw a startup that sells scrubs and hospital gowns claim that their market is “all eight billion people around the world,” because, I assume, everyone might one day go to a hospital? Which, first, [bold strategy, let’s see if it pays off for them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HVejEB5uVk). And second, why stop there? [Ten billion people](https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/DemographicProfiles/Line/900) are going to be born over the next 75 years! And lots of them will be born in hospitals! VCs don’t want to back people swinging for singles and doubles, who are making products for only eight billion people. They want home run hitters, who are selling to *18* billion people!

[^6]: In the data world, the people that they plan on making something for are almost always “people who use Excel.” If I had a dollar for every startup that initially thought [their market](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/lessons-learned-from-a-startup-that#:~:text=We%20defined%20our,support%20them%20all.) was [spreadsheet users](https://every.to/napkin-math/searching-for-signal#:~:text=Finally%2C%20in%202018,the%20most%20popular.), I’d have tens of dollars. If I lost five million dollars for every startup that initially thought their market was spreadsheet users, I’d be a venture capitalist.

[^7]: If your two-step plan is, “We will build an initial product for some people and use that success to build a new product for other people,” that’s a bad plan. If your two-step plan is, “We will build a product for a tiny market with lots of qualifiers and use that success to slowly strip off those qualifiers,” that’s a better plan.

# A very particular set of skills

*If you're really good at something, do that thing?*

---

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gmO6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa90ae8b-cfe4-4ffd-8103-66643d397d6b_1200x630.png)

If you ran a mid-sized coffee chain, and a million Yale-educated lawyers showed up at your corporate headquarters offering you their services for $5.92 an hour, you would have four options:

On one hand, this fourth option is clearly crazy. You run a coffee shop! You sell pastries! It would be insane to try to pivot a cafe into a corporate law firm. On the other hand, it would also be insane not to? You have a million lawyers ready to work for you! For next to nothing! How could a change in circumstances that dramatic *not* change everything about the business that you’re running?

In other words, if you run a business and suddenly you have access to a new resource that has [a very particular set of skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZOywn1qArI), it’s tempting to shoehorn those skills into whatever you’re already doing. You make coffee and need a few lawyers; use the resource to make more coffee or replace your handful of lawyers. But the correct thing to do—or at least the thing that would make you more money—is probably to shoehorn a new business around the resource. Rather than trying to fit the skill to your current problems, find some new problems that match the skill.

Anyway. We can all now hire [a million lawyers](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/the-llama-3-herd-of-models/)[^3] for [$5.92 an hour](https://modal.com/pricing),[^4] and seem to be having trouble figuring out what to do with them. [From Jim Covello](https://www.goldmansachs.com/images/migrated/insights/pages/gs-research/gen-ai--too-much-spend,-too-little-benefit-/TOM_AI%202.0_ForRedaction.pdf), the Head of Global Equity Research at Goldman Sachs:

> Many people seem to believe that AI will be the most important technological invention of their lifetime, but I don’t agree given the extent to which the internet, cell phones, and laptops have fundamentally transformed our daily lives, enabling us to do things never before possible, like make calls, compute and shop from anywhere. Currently, AI has shown the most promise in making existing processes—like coding—more efficient, although estimates of even these efficiency improvements have declined, and the cost of utilizing the technology to solve tasks is much higher than existing methods. For example, we’ve found that AI can update historical data in our company models more quickly than doing so manually, but at six times the cost.
> More broadly, people generally substantially overestimate what the technology is capable of today.[^5] In our experience, even basic summarization tasks often yield illegible and nonsensical results. This is not a matter of just some tweaks being required here and there; despite its expensive price tag, the technology is nowhere near where it needs to be in order to be useful for even such basic tasks. 

Though I love a good [rant](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-snowflake-fails?utm_source=publication-search) about [how](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-an-acquisition-fails) some [popular](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-dbt-fails) thing [fails](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-fivetran-fails)—and I [said something similar](https://benn.substack.com/p/long-on-shovels-short-on-gold#:~:text=But%20for%20as%20much%20as%20tech%20Twitter%20and%20the%20financial%20markets%20have%20become%20enamored%20by%20AI%2C%20it%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20have%20that%20many%20success%20stories%20yet%3F) about AI back in March—this seems like an incomplete argument about its limitations. Almost two years into the generative AI hype cycle, most companies have tried to apply it to existing problems: Help us [write code](https://github.com/features/copilot); help us [create marketing collateral](https://www.jasper.ai/); help us [cheat on our homework](https://essaygenius.ai/). Help us sell coffee. And as Covello says, AI hasn’t been especially good at very many of these things. 

But perhaps that’s because we’re approaching the problem from the wrong side. Perhaps the way AI breaks through—or maybe more concretely, the way that the companies that figure out how to make lots of money with AI end up using it—isn’t by solving some existing problem with an LLM; it’s by changing the problem to make it easy for AI to solve. 

There is some precedent for this sort of thing. Decades ago, big investment firms made money by picking stocks. Though they were quantitatively rigorous about how they made trading decisions—they looked at charts and numbers and most didn’t exclusively invest on hunches[^6]—the problem was fundamentally an analytical one. Experts did some math, stared at their numbers and charts, and tried to outsmart the market. 

And then, computers got really fast. People created early artificial intelligence programs; [one of them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)) “solved” chess, in ways that [made no sense to human players](https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/12/08/147199/alpha-zeros-alien-chess-shows-the-power-and-the-peculiarity-of-ai/). And so, financial firms had two choices: They could either use this new computing technology to make them better stock analysts—that is, they could apply the new resource to an existing problem—or they change the problem to fit the resource, and turn stock trading into a game that could be played by machines that were really good at chess. 

Renaissance Technologies—potentially the [best performing investment firm of all time](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-making-of-the-worlds-greatest-investor-11572667202)—took the second approach:[^7] 

> Early on, [ Renaissance founder Jim ] Simons traded like most others, reading the news and betting on gold prices and other investments. He scored gains but found it hard to endure the market’s volatility. …
> Simons set out to build an automated trading system that could discover fleeting and overlooked patterns in prices.
> “I want models that will make money while I sleep,” Simons told a friend at the time. “A pure system without humans interfering.”

Simons hired a bunch of computer scientists and physicists who knew nothing about finance, and found a problem that could be solved by computers and people who were really good at math:

> It’s clear that the way [ Renaissance Technologies’ executives ] Brown and Mercer approached programming was fundamentally different from the way other hedge-fund programmers thought about it. At Tudor, for example, Sushil Wadhwani trained a machine to approach markets in a way that made sense for human traders. By contrast, Brown and Mercer trained themselves to approach problems in a manner that made sense for computers. … Presented with apparently random data and no further clues, they sift it repeatedly for patterns, exploiting the power of computers to hunt for ghosts that to the human eye would be invisible. …
> Robert Mercer … [says]: “If somebody came up with a theory about how the phases of Venus influence markets, we would want a lot of evidence.” But he adds that “some signals that make no intuitive sense do indeed work.” Indeed, it is the nonintuitive signals that often prove the most lucrative for Renaissance. “The signals that we have been trading without interruption for fifteen years make no sense,” Mercer explains. “Otherwise someone else would have found them.”[^8]

Though Renaissance dropping their old approach and becoming an automated trading firm wasn’t as extreme of a change as a coffee shop becoming a law firm, the two pivots are different in degree more than different in kind. Simons, who taught math at Harvard and MIT, was well connected to lots of mathematicians and scientists. He initially tried to make them financial analysts, and use their skills to help him pick stocks. He discovered they weren’t especially good at that, but they were very good at math. And he realized that, if he could make financial markets a math problem rather than an analytical problem, he could—and then, did—make a lot of money. 

If you have friends who are mathematicians, don’t ask them to be accountants; come up with a way to make solving math problems very lucrative. If you can hire a million lawyers, don’t turn them into baristas; become a law firm. And if you have access to today’s state-of-the-art generative AI models, don’t ask them to send emails and schedule appointments and be digital clones of ourselves; instead, find a problem that can be well solved by a machine that can consume enormous amounts of information, remember nearly all of it, and write remarkably creative, if not always entirely accurate, summaries of what it read.[^9] 

Of course, I don’t know what that problem is. If I did, I wouldn’t be writing a blog; I would have [31 billion dollars](https://www.forbes.com/profile/jim-simons/). But we won’t find these sorts of problems until we stop spending most of our time trying to teach LLMs how to be a better barista.

And at least in the narrow world of the data industry, we seem stuck in the coffee shop. Over the last two years, countless startups have tried to use AI to make us more effective at solving the same problems that we wanted to solve three years ago. AI agents write SQL; they produce documentation; they alert us about anomalies and do root cause analysis; they find “insights.”

They are [not particularly good](https://benn.substack.com/p/llms-shouldnt-write-sql) at any of this. But, startups and big companies alike insist on [plowing](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-databricks-assistant) [ahead](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/copilot-ai-powered-sql-assistant/), trying, as Tudor’s Sushil Wadhwani did, to train the machine to approach data in a way that makes sense for human analysts. And when it not useful, we often “trust that use cases will proliferate [as the technology evolves](https://www.goldmansachs.com/images/migrated/insights/pages/gs-research/gen-ai--too-much-spend,-too-little-benefit-/TOM_AI%202.0_ForRedaction.pdf).” It doesn’t work now, but something something Moore’s law, and it will. 

Maybe, but I'm not convinced. AI, as remarkable as it is, may simply not fit the analytical problem. 

Take Amazon. Amazon is widely considered one of the most effective “data-driven” organizations in the world. Cedric Chin recently [wrote an essay](https://commoncog.com/the-amazon-weekly-business-review/) examining the important pillar of Amazon’s data practice—the weekly business review—and concluded that doing what Amazon does is a very hard *human* concern:

> The WBR is an extremely heavy lift. It assumes you are willing to work at a certain operational cadence, and that you are willing to get at the truth. …
> The problem with the WBR isn’t the mechanical details of doing the meeting. That is easy to articulate, as I have just done in this essay. It’s not even the software that is difficult—Amazon ran their WBRs using Excel in the early years, and printed every goddamn deck on paper.
> No, the problem with the WBR is organisational discipline. It takes a certain amount of operational rigour to compile, examine, and then test a causal model of your business each week. It takes rigour to hold yourself to a high bar of excellence, facing uncomfortable truths early on by looking, unflinchingly, at your numbers, and iterating—always iterating—on your business.

It’s not at all obvious how today’s flavors of AI help with this problem. A robot that can read really fast won’t make us more disciplined. A creative writer won’t hold us to a tight operational cadence. Cold fusion and room-temperature superconductors would be amazing new technologies too, but we wouldn’t try to contort them into a better BI tool. So why should we assume that’s the right thing to do with chatbot?

Better, it seems, to do what Jim Simons did, and try to imagine how we can contort our problem—understanding the world, so we can make better decisions about it—to fit what the technology is good at. 

To me, that means giving up the goal of being “data-driven,” at least as it’s currently understood. It’s [dropping our attachment to numbers and statistical rigor](https://benn.substack.com/p/tilt-and-tilted?utm_source=publication-search), and realizing that good decisions don’t need to trace their origins to spreadsheets. They can also come from careful observation and research—which are [things that LLMs are good at](https://benn.substack.com/p/attn-data). We [don’t need](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/the-space-between-data-dogmatism) to [quantify](https://www.counting-stuff.com/the-importance-of-looking-outside-of-the-data/) something to be smart about it. 

Of course, not every company should do that, just as not every financial firm should turn into a quantitative trading outlet like Renaissance. But if this current generation of AI technologies is to produce its Renaissance, that seems like the sort of company it’ll be—one that all but abandons quantification entirely, so that it can take full advantage of the million researchers and writers who are offering it their services for $5.92 an hour.

[^1]: Apparently, none of the Starbucks fruit drinks contain any of the fruit that’s in their names. There is no mango in the Mango Dragonfruit Refresher; there is no açaí in the Strawberry Açaí Refresher; there is no pineapple in the Pineapple Passionfruit Refresher. Instead, according to a [class action suit](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.584303/gov.uscourts.nysd.584303.29.0.pdf), Starbucks’ “hot chocolate contains cocoa, its matcha lattes contain matcha, and its honey mint tea contains honey and mint,” but its juices “are predominantly made with water, grape juice concentrate, and sugar.” Starbucks argued that this was fine, because the name “describe the *flavors* as opposed to the *ingredients*” of the drinks. There is, I have discovered, a long history of legal precedent about this. Do there need to be whole pieces of wheat in whole wheat bread? No. Do honey graham crackers need to be sweetened with honey? Probably, though it depends on the size of the font on the package (that’s actually real; [see footnote four](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.584303/gov.uscourts.nysd.584303.29.0.pdf)). Do Cap’n Crunch Crunch Berries need to be real berries? No—“no reasonable consumer would believe that Cap’n Crunch derives any nutritional value from berries” because “depictions of the Crunch Berries did not ‘even remotely resemble any naturally occurring fruit of any kind.’” Notably, there is no apparent precedent that says—and Starbucks certainly didn’t attempt to argue—that the Pineapple Passionfruit Refresher can be called a Pineapple Passionfruit Refresher because you’re supposed to drink it *while eating a pineapple*. If we call a food an ingredient, our government officially says, it should probably contain that ingredient, but at least needs to be flavored like that ingredient. [Ahem.](https://benn.substack.com/p/coffee-cake)

[^2]: The rough math: According to a [blog post from Toast](https://pos.toasttab.com/blog/on-the-line/how-much-do-coffee-shops-make), an average coffee shop makes about $4,000 in profit a month, and spends about $14,000 a month on labor. Lowering labor costs by 60 percent would increase the coffee shop’s profit to $12,500 a month, or $150,000 a year. Law firms make about [a million dollars a year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_law_firms_by_revenue) per lawyer; at $5.92 an hour, you could hire a lawyer for less than $20,000 a year, netting you $980,000 of annual profit. Moreover, law firms could probably generate a lot of business by hiring more lawyers and offering their services at below market rates. It’s not clear that coffee shops could meaningfully increase their revenues by underpaying their baristas and offering pour overs for eight dollars instead of ten. (Obviously, the way to meaningfully increase your revenue as a coffee shop is to start selling [Cinnamon Toast Crunch lattes](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-kkby9RaRr/).)

[^3]: [According to Meta’s AI team](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/the-llama-3-herd-of-models/), Llama 3, Meta’a open source LLM, got 80 percent of the questions right on the LSAT (which [converts to a score](https://www.kaptest.com/study/lsat/lsat-raw-score-conversion/) in the low 160s), scored a 162 on the quantitative section of the GRE, and a 166 on the verbal section. The [median Yale Law](https://law.yale.edu/admissions-financial-aid/jd-admissions/yale-law-school-numbers) student typically scores a 175 on the LSAT, scores 163 on the quantitative section of the GRE and 167 on the verbal section.

[^9]: People often cite LLMs’ inaccuracies as a big problem, which has always struck me as a little strange. That complaint makes sense if you think of them as bad computers, but makes less sense if you think of them as better people. As a person to read a book and tell you what happened, and they’ll get some stuff wrong. Ask an LLM to read a million books, and it’ll get less wrong.

# How a startup feels

*Why some of us are unfit for the magical mystery money machine.*

---

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RtQG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13fd6c32-e716-4323-9c7a-8044d4b1125d_1200x600.png)
*[“Oops.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoCof5AtMoI)*

One way to think about a startup is as a machine that prints money. Or a machine that *could* print money, if you configure it well. If you run the machine just so, it will make you rich. If you run it exceptionally well, it can print enough money to make you [one of the richest people in the world](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#ef31c083d788). If you run it badly, it will [send you to jail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Javice).[^1] It is important to configure it well.

The machine, however, is hard to use. You can’t just buy one by sending a [couple hundred dollars to Delaware](https://corpfiles.delaware.gov/AugustFee2024.pdf) and turn it on. No, you have to carefully run the machine, and the machine is complicated. It is controlled by thousands of knobs and levers, and every switch will cause the machine to print different amounts of money, or burn different amounts of money, or commit different amounts of crime. Again, it is important to configure it well.

Unfortunately, in addition to the machine having lots of knobs and levers, nothing on the machine is well labeled. You don’t really know what any of the knobs and levers do. There is a wire coming out of the back of each one, but they are all tangled together. Some of the wires might be severed, and might not be connected to the machine at all. Some of the wires conduct electrical signals very well, and the machine responds immediately when you turn the knobs connected to them. Some of the wires are full of tar, and conduct electrical currents exceptionally slowly.[^2] If you flip a switch connected to one of those wires, the signal may not reach the machine for weeks or months. You don’t know which wires are which. All you can do is experiment. 

But even that doesn’t always work. Some wires are spliced together with other wires; switches connected to those wires will do different things depending on the configuration of the other switches. Some wires are frayed: Turn some knobs too far, and their wires become fuses. And some wires are influenced by outside forces, like the seasons, and the federal funds rate, and what’s trending on TikTok.

The switches themselves are also complicated. Some of them move on their own. Some periodically reset themselves to their old positions. Some buttons can't be pushed until other buttons are pushed; some buttons [can only be pushed once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxsdOQa_QkM). Some knobs can be turned easily, and some take a tremendous amount of effort to move.

When former founders and venture capitalists write their tell-all blogs and [LinkedIn memoirs](https://benn.substack.com/p/ed-harris-would-like-to-connect-with#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand,it%E2%80%99s%20editorial%20calendar%20crosstalk.) about startups, this last point is often the central theme of their narrative: That running a startup is *hard*. It takes [intensely hard work](https://ampitupbook.com/); it requires doing [intensely uncomfortable things](https://a16z.com/books/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things/); it demands [intensely long hours](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1067175527180513280); it is [intensely all-consuming](https://paulgraham.com/really.html#:~:text=2.%20Startups%20Take%20Over%20Your%20Life). Last year, Jensen Huang, the founder of Nvidia, which is currently the [second-best configured machine in the world](https://companiesmarketcap.com/), famously said the work [wasn’t worth](https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/bay-area-ceo-says-suffering-wasnt-worth-it-18445094.php) the $35 billion he made from doing it:[^3] 

> Building a company and building Nvidia turned out to have been a million times harder than I expected it to be—any of us expected it to be. And at that time, if we realized the pain and suffering, and just how vulnerable you're going to feel, and the challenges that you're going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame, and the list of all the things that go wrong, I don't think anyone would start a company. Nobody in their right mind would do it. 

I’ve brought up this quote before, to make the same point that everyone makes: Work is every startup’s [only enduring competitive advantage](https://benn.substack.com/p/why-are-we-still-surprised-that-startups#:~:text=work%20we%E2%80%99ve%20put%20in%20becomes%20our%20only%20competitive%20advantage.). Effort is the defining input to a startup; exhaustion is the defining feeling. It is important to configure the machine well, and the machine takes a lot of energy to configure. 

It’s a simple, enticing truth—but perhaps a misleading one. These sorts of stories suggest that starting a startup is, first and foremost, about committing yourself to doing a lot of work. They suggest that the question you should ask yourself, if you’re deciding whether or not to ignore Jensen Huang’s warnings, is if you’re willing to put in the time. Will you be [in the gym at 5 a.m.](https://www.instagram.com/kobehighlight_/reel/C31ItPVveRC/)? Will you [quickly respond](https://vcmastery.substack.com/p/speed-why-founder-email-responsiveness) to every email? Will you [clean the toilets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-I6UyUO8GMk)? If you’re ready for the grindset, you’re ready for the machine. 

But that, I’d argue, is not its essential character. The thing that makes the magical mystery money machine a magical mystery money machine is its mystery: You don’t know how it works. It isn’t hard to operate because the switches are hard to flip—though they are—it is hard to operate because you don’t know what the switches do. And the prevailing emotion isn’t stress, from knowing how much work has to be done; it is the stress from *not knowing what to do.*

There will be moments—days, months, the entire lifetime of the startup—when the machine doesn’t work. Perhaps the machine once worked, and now it’s [gummed itself up](https://www.harryglaser.com/when-the-growth-slows/), printing less and less money every day. Perhaps the machine is in crisis: [it is overheating](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-internet-2022), it is on fire; it is hemorrhaging fuel; it is hemorrhaging vital parts. Perhaps the machine [never worked](https://www.cascade.io/), and no matter how its configured, it lies lifeless, unable to burp out a single dollar. 

To stare at these problems is to stare at a router, when all the lights are green, but your computer refuses to say anything other than something went wrong, it can’t connect to the internet, try again later. It is to stare at your broken router when your friends are over for the Super Bowl, the game is about to start, and people are here because they believe in your wifi and your leadership. It is to stare at some malfunctioning machine, simultaneously needing it to work while also knowing next to nothing about *how* it works. It is to stare at a problem that is urgent, vague, and fatal. 

More concretely: People aren’t buying the product. Or a competitor just [launched a rebrand](https://store.kamalaharris.com/harris-walz-printed-camo-hat/), and [they’re stealing customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ou6MEKQWwY). Key employees are leaving. Marketing campaigns can’t seem to bring in new leads. The new [social media initiative flopped](https://x.com/MeidasTouch/status/1826674904806424962). The mobile app is chronically buggy, and new features are chronically behind schedule. The trajectory isn’t sustainable, you know it’s not sustainable, *everyone* knows it’s not sustainable, and the machine has to be fixed. 

But…how? Though the Silicon Valley content mill will tell you how to solve these problems—for finding product-market fit, talk to more customers; for flagging employee morale, [buy people pizzas](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/benn-stancil_transforming-into-san-diego-activity-7122597547751161859-qJnz/); for slowing growth, up up down down left right left right B A start—these instructions are unreliable. Everyone’s money machine is different. Are the wires from these dials connected to your machine in the way the blog posts say they are? Are they connected at all? How far do you turn them, and how long do you wait to find out if they work? 

This, I think, is the answer to the riddle of why [we’re surprised that startups are hard](https://benn.substack.com/p/why-are-we-still-surprised-that-startups). It’s not the amount of work that surprises us, but the nature of that work: Sitting in front of a [mixing console worth of controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console#/media/File:SSL_SL9000J_(72ch)_@_The_Cutting_Room_Recording_Studios,_NYC.jpg) and not knowing what to do. It is important to configure the machine well, and you will have no idea how to do it.[^4]

In hindsight, it was a machine that I was perhaps constitutionally unfit to run. If you’re given a sea of mysterious levers to pull and your response is to cautiously analyze the situation—if you do things like, say, I don’t know, repeatedly write thousands of words about niche software trends—you will compact yourself under a [Shepard tone of relentless pressure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVWTQcZbLgY).[^5] 

Though that one probably should’ve been obvious, what’s less obvious is that the machine also can’t be run by people who are prone to perpetual action. Button mashing in response to problems—and there will always be problems—rarely fixes the machine, and tells you nothing about it actually works.[^6] The machine will change, but based on what? Was it because two switches were flipped at once? Has the signal from the knob you turned six months ago finally passed through its [long wire](https://www.iexexchange.io/technology#:~:text=It's%20a%20simple%20technology%3A%2038,at%20the%20exchange's%20matching%20engine.)? Button mashers will have done something, but they still won’t know what to do.

Instead, the people who are best able to run the machine are probably [psychopaths](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/13/1-in-5-ceos-are-psychopaths-australian-study-finds/), for better or for worse. They are people who are convinced that they know how the machine works. They don’t look at a bunch of levers and wonder what to do, nor do they try to experiment with every switch. They look at the dials and just decide—based on intuition? Delusion?—how to turn each one. To people of this sort, the machine isn’t stressful, because to them, the levers are labeled.

That, of course, blows up a lot of machines; you are unlikely to simply guess the right way to configure it. But both indecision and erratic action blow up a lot of machines too—more, probably, because at least guessing a plan and sticking to it *could* work. Plus, if you’re going to commit to running the machine for a while, you can save yourself a lot of anxiety by picking a set of switches and doing whatever it takes to flip those. It is important to configure the machine well, and you might as well tell yourself that you know how to do it.

![Air: Ben Affleck's movie is fun, but it squanders the true story.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!383M!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d2b7aa5-cfd7-465c-bf50-f3db844ec4ad_1560x1040.jpeg)
*[Ben Affleck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Euy4Yu6B3nU)*

If you’re reading this, there’s a decent chance that you’re here because of [a post I wrote](https://benn.substack.com/p/metrics-layer) in 2021 called “The missing piece of the modern data stack.” To the degree that a gossip blog about startup middleware has “hits,” that article was my biggest one: It doubled the subscriber base (into triple figures!), has directly accounted for more signups than any other article, and is the third-most viewed thing on this Substack, despite fewer than 100 people getting the original email. If you could [trace the series of events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h2LD6nfbMM) that led you here—from someone reading something to sharing something to someone else reading something to sharing something else, to it eventually leading you to this spot, right now—that post would probably be the first domino.

It’s also the post, and perhaps the only post, that has moved the world in some detectable way. The metrics layer—the name I gave the part of the modern data stack that I said was missing—has been [adopted](https://www.tableau.com/blog/what-is-tableau-pulse-metrics-layer) by a [handful](https://atlan.com/metrics-layer/) of [content](https://www.secoda.co/glossary/metrics-layer) marketing [teams](https://www.metabase.com/community_posts/what-is-a-metrics-layer-and-how-your-company-can-benefit-from-it). It was [born](https://hex.tech/blog/dbt-transform/); it was [explained](https://databased.pedramnavid.com/p/what-is-the-metrics-layer); it was [debated](https://www.thoughtspot.com/blog/the-metrics-layer-has-growing-up-to-do); it [died](https://win.hyperquery.ai/p/the-metrics-layer-is-dead). [Some startups](https://medium.com/@vfisa/an-overview-of-metric-layer-offerings-a9ddcffb446e) tried to build it; Google [spun](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/introducing-looker-modeler) “a standalone metrics layer” out of Looker. For a moment, it became A Thing.[^1]

It was also a bad idea?

I mean, I don’t know that, not for sure, not yet. But the trajectory isn’t great. By the end of 2021, at least [six companies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uBWluKGPNk&t=606s) were building a product that could reasonably be called a metrics layer. [Two](https://www.supaglue.com/blog/pivoting-to-supaglue) [pivoted](https://www.hellotrace.io/), one [got acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/08/dbt-acquires-transform/), and one [stalled](https://github.com/metriql/metriql). Two are still growing—Cube raised [some money](https://cube.dev/blog/cubes-raises-25-million) in June, and dbt still sells [their semantic layer](https://www.getdbt.com/product/semantic-layer)—but neither have become [anything close](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/192b61u/is_anyone_using_the_dbt_semantic_layer/) to a market standard. Google has [gone silent](https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/1d4dr6y/what_happened_to_looker_modeler/) about their spinoff. In 2022, the industry was chasing the idea; now, after some false starts and disappointing v1’s, it’s slowly backing away from it. 

Perhaps this all changes. Perhaps it just takes a few iterations; perhaps things standardize slowly, and [then all at once](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/102579-how-did-you-go-bankrupt-two-ways-gradually-then-suddenly). I wouldn’t bet on it—I already [tried that](https://benn.ventures/), in a [couple ways](https://mode.com/blog/mode-integration-with-dbt)—but you never know. 

I say all of this to make two pretty obvious points. First, bad ideas sometimes sound like good ideas, and second, until you try it, it’s really hard to tell the difference. We can [all debate](https://x.com/frasergeorgew/status/1468986410464002053) the viability of some new idea on Twitter forever; we can all come up with some clever reason why our side is right; someone could even “win” the argument by saying something that sounds more clever than what everyone else said. But until someone goes out and tries the thing, we haven’t figured anything out yet. A compelling rhetorical argument isn’t the same thing as the truth. The only real truth is what happens. 

But what if that argument is made with logic and reason? What if it’s made with *data*? We’ve talked [about this](https://benn.substack.com/p/tilt-and-tilted) before: These are still just arguments, and logic, reason, and data are, outside of mathematical proofs, still just rhetorical devices. Filling that blog post about metrics layers with charts wouldn’t have made it any more true; it would’ve just made the argument more compelling, and harder to disagree with. 

Of course, there is some subtlety here. If we accept that there is some Objective Truth out there—that the metrics layer doesn’t work, or, to choose a random headline from the *New York Times* this morning, that [interest rate cuts won’t fix a global housing affordability crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/business/economy/interest-rate-cuts-housing-affordability-crisis.html)—it’s probably easier to make both logical and quantitative arguments in favor of that truth than it is to make arguments in support of the opposite. That’s why analysis works, to the extent that it does: Not because it finds the truth, but because finding a sound argument for something that is true is easier than finding a sound argument for something that is false.[^2] 

Anyway, a month ago, a former brand director at Nike [published a rant](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nike-epic-saga-value-destruction-massimo-giunco-llplf/) about how the company screwed up their brand. The post accused Nike of making a long list of strategic mistakes: They tilted too far towards direct-to-consumer digital sales; they favored brand design over brand communication;[^3] they decided to “eliminate categories from the organization” and to rely less on their wholesales business; they mismanaged their supply chain; they focused too much on their loyalty programs. They did a lot wrong, and honestly, if you don’t know how global apparel businesses work (which I do not), it was a little hard to follow.[^4]

But the internet quickly [collapsed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse) the post into a single viral headline: Nike’s original sin was trying to be “data-driven.” From the post:

> A few months later, after his first tour around the Nike world, the CEO announced – via email – his decisions: … Nike will change its marketing model, centralizing it and making it data driven and digitally led. …
> Because of that, Nike invested a material amount of dollars (billions) into something that was less effective but easier to be measured vs something that was more effective but less easy to be measured.

This part of the post broke through the [LinkedIn firewall](https://benn.substack.com/p/ed-harris-would-like-to-connect-with#:~:text=But%20what%20goes%20viral%20on%20LinkedIn%E2%80%94like%20this%20post%2C%20which%20was%20viewed%20five%20million%20times%E2%80%94stays%20on%20LinkedIn.) and into the general discourse.[^5] We must be more careful with how we use data, [people said](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/the-space-between-data-dogmatism); data is not reality; the map is not the territory. Others had [harsher criticism](https://uxdesign.cc/nikes-25b-blunder-shows-us-the-limits-of-data-driven-ad30b6e3d938): This was “fixed-mindset thinking;” Nike’s “incestuous strategy” spun them into a “data-driven death spiral.”

Which, ok; the first set of points seem true enough; the second set of points probably aren’t wrong, though they feel like an over-extrapolation of the original post. But even if we accept all of this as true—that Nike did what the person on LinkedIn said, and it failed for the reasons that the internet said—it still leaves a glaring question unanswered: Why didn’t they know better? Rough truisms like “data has blind spots” were surely as well understood by lifelong Nike veterans as they are by internet bloggers and LinkedIn thought leaders. If it is so easy to criticize Nike’s strategy from a distance, why was it so hard to resist it from up close?[^6]

The problem, I imagine, isn’t data, exactly; it’s culture. Even though most people and companies aren’t data-driven in the canonical sense—they aren’t making decisions by responding to some flickering Bloomberg terminal of charts and numbers—most people are at least data-pilled. We like *Moneyball*. We like the [old OkCupid blog](https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/11/6132023/okcupid-data-blog-is-back-in-book-form). We thought [Nate Silver was a witch](https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/07/nate-silver-as-software/). We “trust science;” science is objective; science uses data; data is objective; [in God we trust, all others must bring data](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780191866692.001.0001/q-oro-ed6-00019739). Though we understand that data has limits, twenty years of cargo culting about Google and Netflix and [Renaissance](https://benn.substack.com/p/a-very-particular-set-of-skills#:~:text=Renaissance%20Technologies%E2%80%94potentially%20the%20best%20performing%20investment%20firm%20of%20all%20time%E2%80%94took%20the%20second%20approach) and the [Oakland A’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSSlOByCwqI&t=261s) put it on an argumentative pedestal. If you want something, you can 1) just say what you want, 2) say it, but loudly and often, 3), say it in some clever way, or 4) say it with a graph. Though there’s not *that* much difference between those things, modern society strongly prefers the fourth version. 

This, I think, creates a kind of vibes-based meta-bias. Rather than favoring the [highest-paid person’s opinion](https://growthmethod.com/hippo-effect/), we favor the SWAN (Suggestion With A lot of Numbers), almost regardless of what those numbers say. The effect of this isn’t to mindlessly optimize the stuff that we can measure, but to assign a certain amount of truth to arguments made with measurements. I doubt that Nike focused on Nike.com memberships and forgot about “brand magic” because they could easily measure the first one and not the second one. I do suspect, however, that the team that was working on Nike.com memberships could make a lot of compelling arguments about corporate strategy that the team working on brand magic could not. When both teams are pitching their ideas, they are pitching things that probably sound like good ideas, but might be bad ideas. But if the memberships team can make their pitch with numbers and forecasts and statistics, it sounds less like an opinion and more like a fact. 

Put differently, doing quantitative analysis *feels like figuring something out*. It feels like a shortcut to the end; it reveals “[insights](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dereksteer_insights-are-bullshit-and-the-analytics-activity-7227354124613246977-wLvj);” it is a way to know something, or at least get reasonably close to knowing something, without *doing* something. But it is not. As Nikita Baer [put it in a recent podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1147s), the only real way to figure anything out is to [get punched in the face](https://rowansimpson.com/quotes/punch/):  

> The most important thing that I often instruct teams to do is to develop a reproducible testing process, and that will actually influence the probability of your success more than anything. It's so unpredictable whether a consumer product idea will work. If you actually focus more on your process for taking many shots at bat, that's what actually reduces the risk more than anything.

Or, more succinctly, from [Cedric Chin](https://commoncog.com/the-idea-maze-is-a-useless-idea/#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20ex%2Dante%20strategy%20for%20finding%20a%20secret%20beyond%20%E2%80%9Cfuck%20around%20and%20find%20out%E2%80%9D.): “There is no ex-ante strategy for finding a secret beyond “fuck around and find out.’”

Data is useful for finding out by being useful in measuring interventions—the experiments, the building of the metrics layer, the new organizational structure at Nike. It is useful as [a step in the scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#/media/File:The_Scientific_Method.svg), not a replacement for it. 

To paraphrase a coworker, the opposite of a debate-driven culture is not a data-driven culture. They are actually the same thing, just with debaters wielding different weapons. Instead, the opposite of a debate-driven culture is—appropriately—a [do-stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yO7xLAGugQ)-culture.

Either way, to me, the interesting thought experiment is to imagine a world where you could [generate a logically sound argument for anything](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-analysis-dies). Surely there is some arrangement of words out that would make an seemingly airtight argument about why the metrics layer is a catastrophically bad idea, and surely there is a [tortured set of economic data](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/if_you_torture_the_data_long_enough,_it_will_confess_to_anything) that seems to prove that interest rate cuts *will* fix a global housing affordability crisis. How would we deal with that? If there is a good case for every idea, it seems like our ability to reason would sort of break down at that point.

# Getting away with it

*Fine, fOuNdEr MoDe.*

![Who Was Andy Warhol and Why His Art Was So Important](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yeaN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31fdcd66-f9c6-4a68-b83f-6fcb2a45d10b_1503x1000.jpeg)

At some point shortly after I started working in tech, I once asked a coworker if it was possible for us to build some part of a website in a particular way. He told me of course it is; it just depends on how much time we want to spend on it. It was a computer, he said; we can make whatever we want. 

What a silly thing to say, I thought.

But over the years, as I started to learn how to write a little bit of code,[^1] I realized his answer wasn't pithy, but profound. As long as you stay within a few broad boundaries, you really can make whatever you want. There is no feature that is impossible to build; there is no dream design that can only be imagined; there is no div that can't eventually be centered. There are common patterns, and there are simple paths of little resistance, but there are almost no *rules*. We are far more constrained by our own sense of comfort—both in what feels familiar and in how much we’re willing to risk to try something new—than an actual leash. Computers don’t tie us down; [we do](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10362328-he-saw-a-baby-elephant-tied-to-a-post-with). 

Such is life. We drop our own anchors. We get [settled into our ways](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-past-is-not-precious); we follow the paths [that others suggest to us](https://benn.substack.com/i/146084626/one-ruler-to-reign-them-all); we explore our neighborhoods, but not the foreign countryside that we can’t immediately see. When we leave a job to “pursue other interests,” those interests are usually small variants of what came before: Not SaaS, but B2B! Not a large tech company, but a small one! Not a designer, but a PM! Either explicitly or through the blinders we put on ourselves, we develop fences for ourselves—our shoulds and shouldn’ts, our cans and won’ts; the identities that are us, and the ones that [we can’t pull off](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/style/denim-jean-jacket.html). 

Professionally, these prescriptions can be especially potent. Not only does it feel like we can get punished for breaking them, but it also feels like we get rewarded for following them. There is always a promotion two review cycles away. Play by the rules, and someone will invite you onto the next rung up the corporate ladder. Deviate too much—by doing something unconventional, or by trying to vault yourself to another ladder in some distant field—and you risk falling. 

Silicon Valley fancies itself as thinking differently. It’s for the [crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels](https://fs.blog/steve-jobs-crazy-ones/). It’s for “thinking from first principles.” It’s for people who want to play their own game, and who, both metaphorically and literally, see a computer and think, we can make whatever we want. 

But, for better or worse, Silicon Valley is not so much a place with no expectations and norms; it just has its own version of them. There is a corporate ladder here too, and a playbook for how to climb it. [Look for rocket ships.](https://thevcfactory.com/if-youre-offered-a-seat-on-a-rocket-ship-dont-ask-what-seat-sheryl-sandberg/)[^2] Start a company. Run it by axiomatic motto: Move fast and break things; [make stuff people want](https://paulgraham.com/good.html); iterate; disrupt; have strong opinions that are weakly held. Our rules are insurgent, but they are rules, and they are also hard to break.[^3] 

This week, Paul Graham [gave us another one](https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html) (if you’ve used the internet for the last week, you’ve already read all this):

> …the conventional wisdom about how to run larger companies is mistaken. As Airbnb grew, well-meaning people advised [Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky] that he had to run the company in a certain way for it to scale. Their advice could be optimistically summarized as "hire good people and give them room to do their jobs." He followed this advice and the results were disastrous. So he had to figure out a better way on his own, which he did partly by studying how Steve Jobs ran Apple. So far it seems to be working. Airbnb's free cash flow margin is now among the best in Silicon Valley. …
> In effect there are two different ways to run a company: founder mode and manager mode. Till now most people even in Silicon Valley have implicitly assumed that scaling a startup meant switching to manager mode. But we can infer the existence of another mode from the dismay of founders who've tried it, and the success of their attempts to escape from it. …
> Look at what founders have achieved already, and yet they've achieved this against a headwind of bad advice. Imagine what they'll do once we can tell them how to run their companies like Steve Jobs instead of John Sculley.

There are two ways to read this: One pithy, and one ([reluctantly](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-calendar-takes-its-tax?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=If%20this%20Substack%20had%20an%20early%20nemesis%2C%20it%20would%20be%20Paul%20Graham.)) profound. The first—and the way that it seems to be getting digested by much of the internet—is that founder mode is itself a new set of rules. Rather than having a few direct reports, have a bunch. Rather than delegating, stay involved. Someday, someone will write a viral “Manager Mode/Founder Mode” blog post that lists out the poles of each: Manager mode is a bureaucratic tar pit created by pinheaded pencil pushers with email jobs. Founder mode is using a [machete to cut through red tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5KmB8Laemg&t=80s). Manager mode is scheduling a blameless retro. Founder mode is solving a problem. Manager mode is *Office Space*. Founder mode is Logan Roy fanfic. 

This version—founder mode as a vibe—probably isn’t very useful. It is yet another cliche that, though perhaps not necessarily wrong, provides no practical guidance on how to actually navigate managerial challenges. It is a headline, a pull quotes, a bulleted listicle, packaged into bite-sized tweet or podcast soundbite that is designed to be consumed by inexperienced executives in the back of an Uber.[^4] Examples of how to put these ideas into practice, the complicated nuance behind applying them in real-life situations to real-life people, and the exceptions that reveal that they’re not irrefutable laws of startup leadership do not fit into the meme.[^5] Founder mode is not advice; it’s [something to yell](https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2020-01-27/kobe-bryant-jump-shots-legacy) when you bulldoze into a meeting and make the decision yourself. [^6]

There is a broader way to interpret Graham’s post, however: It is a reminder that *there are no rules*.[^7] The point is not to copy Steve Jobs, and to run a company the way he ran his; that is, after all, the antithesis of thinking differently. The point is to be inspired by Steve Jobs, and to come up with your own way of doing it. It is to stand on the ledge before an infinite pit of options, and, despite the dizzying vertigo, finding conviction in something. It is to move to the music without worrying about whether other people think your dancing is good or bad. Hosting an annual retreat for 100 people because that’s what they do at Apple isn’t “founder mode;” it’s cargo culting.

This, of course, is hard to do. We love tactical advice and key takeaways. Startups are hard because [they are broken machines](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-a-startup-feels) and we often don’t know what to do to fix them. Instructions would be nice. That could be big retreats, or staying involved in customer support conversations, or personally approving every product update. Or it could be the opposite of all of those things—which, at the rate we’re going, may become as counterintuitive as [Jensen Huang having 60 reports](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nvidias-ceo-has-60-reports-doesnt-do-11s-hes-crazy-heres-derek-steer-sxeqc) seems today. But founder mode is not the answer to that question; it is simply permission to look for a solution. The rest of the problem is up to us.

Anyway, the best summary of all of this​​, and how it seems like it will manifest itself in the real world, is from [comedian Anthony Jeselnik](https://www.tiktok.com/@anthonyjeselnik/video/7309578295408856362):

> All these comics now, it's almost like the point is to get in trouble. It's like, "Why are you giving me shit? I'm a comic, I'm allowed to say whatever I want." That's wrong, as far as I'm concerned. People think as a comic, your job is to get in trouble, but they don't want to get yelled out. Like it's ok to make people mad, but they don't want any pushback, and I think that's wrong. 
> As a comedian, you want to make people laugh. There's a quote attributed to Andy Warhol that I love: "Art is getting away with it." If you put out a special, and everyone's pissed, you didn't get away with it. You need to make everyone laugh, so that they're like, "Yeah, he talked about some fucked up stuff, but we're all happy." That's art. Otherwise, you're just a troll.

Founder mode—and really, leadership, but that’s [harder to brand](https://www.vox.com/culture/24062406/tiktok-trends-slang-terms-coining)—is the same thing: It is doing something daring and getting away with it. That is why Steve Jobs is Steve Jobs—not because he thought differently, but because he did something bold *and* *it worked*. The second thing is more important than the first. 

And that’s a mode that anyone can operate in. There is a curious line in the final footnote of Graham’s post, when he says his advice could get abused by “managers who aren't founders will decide they should try to act like founders.” The implication, it seems, is that founders—[because](https://x.com/yanatweets/status/1830728471380902048) they are the company’s “parent,” and because they know its history—have permission to color outside of the lines, whereas other people do not.[^8] 

Superficially, sure. But, while founders might have more default permissions than other employees, everyone is ultimately governed by one law and one law alone: You can do it, if you can get away with it.

# Do AI companies work?

*The market needs to be irrational for you to stay solvent. *

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IAAY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ec1c7ad-3195-4860-a7a7-a800dfeb58b2_1440x808.png)

I mean, surely something in this sequence is wrong, right?

Eighteen months ago, I said that foundational LLM vendors are potentially [the next generation of cloud providers](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-public-imagination):

> So here's an obvious prediction: AI will follow a nearly identical trajectory [as AWS, Azure, and GCP]. In ten years, a new type of cloud—a generative one, a commercial Skynet, a public imagination—will undergird nearly every piece of technology we use. 

Other people have [made similar comparisons](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/openai-gives-you-next-aws-google-search-howie-xu/). And on the surface, the analogy seems roughly reasonable. Foundational models require tons of money to build, just like cloud services do. Both could become ubiquitous pieces of the global computing infrastructure. The market for both is easily in the tens of billions of dollars, likely in the hundreds of billions, and potentially in the trillions. 

There is, however, one enormous difference that I didn’t think about: *You can’t build a cloud vendor overnight. *Azure doesn’t have to worry about a few executives leaving and building a worldwide network of data centers in 18 months. AWS is an internet business, but it dug its competitive moat in the physical world. The same is true for a company like Coca-Cola: The secret recipe is important, but not *that *important, because a Y Combinator startup couldn’t build factories and distribution centers and relationships with millions of retailers over the course of [a three month sprint](https://www.ycombinator.com/about#:~:text=YC%20is%20a%20three%20month%20program.%20%C2%A0).

But an AI vendor could? Though OpenAI’s work requires a lot of physical computing resources, they’re leased (from Microsoft, or AWS, or GCP), not built. Given enough money, anyone could have access to the same resources. It’s not hard to imagine a small team of senior researchers leaving OpenAI, [raising a ton of money to rent some computers](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-co-founder-sutskevers-new-safety-focused-ai-startup-ssi-raises-1-billion-2024-09-04/), and being a legitimate disruptive threat to OpenAI’s core business in a matter of months. 

In other words, the billions that AWS spent on building data centers is a lasting defense. The billions that OpenAI spent on building prior versions of GPT is not, because better versions of it are already [available for free on Github](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama). Stylistically, Anthropic put itself deeply in the red to build ten incrementally better models; eight are now worthless, the ninth is open source, and the tenth is the thin technical edge that is keeping Anthropic alive. Whereas cloud providers can be disrupted, it would almost have to happen slowly. Every LLM vendor is eighteen months from dead.[^3] 

What, then, is an LLM vendor’s moat? Brand? Inertia? A better set of applications built on top of their core models? An ever-growing bonfire of cash that keeps its models [a nose ahead](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bHKPQGHSqqE) of a hundred competitors? 

I honestly don’t know. But AI companies seem to be an extreme example of the market [misclassifying software development costs as upfront investments](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-software-companies-actually-have) rather than necessary ongoing expenses. An LLM vendor that doesn’t spend tens of millions of dollars a year—and maybe billions, for the leaders—improving their models is a year or two from being out of business. 

Though that math might work for huge companies like Google and Microsoft, and for OpenAI, which has become synonymous with artificial intelligence, it’s hard to see how that works for smaller companies that aren’t already bringing in sizable amounts of revenue. Though [giant round funding rounds](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/french-ai-startup-h-raises-220-million-seed-round/), often given to pedigreed founders, can help them jump to front of the race, it’s not at all obvious [how they stay there](https://sifted.eu/articles/three-cofounders-leave-h-news), because someone else will do the same thing a year later. The have to  either raise enormous amounts of money in perpetuity,[^4] or they have to start making billions of dollars a year. That’s an awfully high hurdle for survival.

In this market, timing may be everything: At some point, the hype will die down, and people won’t be able to raise these sorts of rounds. And the winners won’t be who ran the fastest or reached some finish line, but whoever was leading when the market decided the race is over.

# Welcome to benn.ventures

*Because what else do we do?*

---

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZPe1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c09d7a9-2ea2-4779-9c77-36cb2880af06_1600x1095.png)

To say it bluntly, [I can't stand Slack](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-product-is-the-process?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=And%20it%20makes%20us%20worse%20at%20our%20jobs.%C2%A0). Superficially, it’s as good as software gets—it’s snappy and well-built; it’s approachable and friendly, both in its design and its personality; it has lots of ergonomic conveniences, from a wide set of keyboard shortcuts to [impressively robust notification controls](https://x.com/mengxilu/status/1550519453598642176). And its funfetti brand was so popular that [it reinvented](https://benn.substack.com/p/we-dont-need-another-sql-chatbot#footnote-2-134863380) the entire enterprise software aesthetic. None of this is bad, though I could do without all of the [emojis](https://benn.substack.com/p/delirium?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=ornery%20as%20before.-,I%20still%20hate%20emojis,-%2C%20and%20would%20rather).

But the bones of Slack’s glittering applications? The bones are horrible. Slack replaced well-organized email threads with a sprawling interchange of company-wide crosstalk. Companies that run on Slack run on [group chats](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/magazine/group-chats.html)—there’s a text thread for every team, for every project, for every hobby and resource group, and, eventually, a group DM for every possible combination of five-or-fewer people. The day you start using Slack, it's a delightful little instant messenger. A year later, you have 3,000 unread channels, dozens of channels you've learned to ignore, and a sidebar multiplying towards infinity.

The issue, it seems, is that slack is for *chatting*. And chatting is for things like sharing pictures of your cats, or telling people that [you’re running late](https://www.tiktok.com/@madibwebb/video/7393758114035649823), or [coordinating an ambush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4) on World of Warcraft.

Workplace communication is different. It's not inane chatter; it is—or at least, should be—more thoughtful conversation. Moreover, lots of messages need to be *triaged. *A request from your boss needs to be completed later; a long document needs your feedback; the matching criterion for the 21st input parameter in Channel File 291 of the IPC Template Instance *really* [needs to be reviewed](https://www.crowdstrike.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Channel-File-291-Incident-Root-Cause-Analysis-08.06.2024.pdf). If you get asked to do these things over email, you have options for how to manage them: Mark urgent stuff as unread; star them; leave to-dos in your inbox; delete or archive the chatter. And when you respond to a message, email forces you to reply in a thread. 

Slack does neither of these things. The principal thing that Slack encourages you to do is post a new message in a chronological chat room. And managing those messages is next to impossible, because Slack collapses everything into the blunt concepts of read and unread. Messages are either flagged with a literal red alert, or they’re effectively erased, thrown into a unrelenting river of automated posts and dissociative corporate prattle. There is no way to organize what’s happening in chat; there is no functional inbox for triaging stuff that’s read. In Slack, speak now, or the chaos will have moved on. 

For a couple years, there was a third option. Yammer, the first tech company I worked for, built one of the early products that tried to replace email with a SaaS app. In many ways, it was the opposite of Slack: [The construction was shoddy, but the bones were great.](https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/05/yammer-we-just-cant-quit-you/)

The design of Yammer was almost identical to Facebook. There was a feed of messages, with replies threaded below them.[^1] The first message in each thread was the most prominent, and, as on Facebook and LinkedIn, the UI encouraged people to directly reply to messages rather than start new threads. Yammer also made a simple adjustment to how the feed was organized: When someone replied to a thread, that threat got bumped to the top of the feed. Conversations that generated a lot of replies tended to bubble up frequently, whereas less active conversations eventually fell off the screen. 

Yammer also [had an inbox](https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/14/yammer-gets-hootsuite-integration-and-needed-design-improvements-independent-of-microsoft/) that let people triage conversations. It functioned much like email: If you were added to a thread, it’d get added to your inbox. When new messages were posted in one of those threads, the inbox would mark it as unread. See the message, it gets marked as read. If you want to remove a message from your inbox entirely, you could. 

It worked, and much better than I thought it would. You could go to the groups you cared about, and scroll through the feed, and read the thread starters just as you would skim subject lines. If something was interesting, you read the replies. If not, you moved on, slightly more aware of what was going on than before. Over time, you developed an atmospheric sense of what was happening—and because important conversations would naturally resurface, you rarely missed the key headlines. 

Unfortunately, Yammer never really caught on. It looked too much like a social network, so most of its customers used it as a water cooler rather than as an internal replacement for email. It eventually got bought, [rebranded into oblivion](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/engage), and tucked into some [back corner](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/products-apps-services) of the Office suite, behind Microsoft’s own Slack clone. 

## Glued on

A few months ago, Yammer founder, venture capitalist, and podcast host David Sacks launched [Glue.ai](http://glue.ai). Demos of Glue [look like a mashup](https://x.com/GlueAI/status/1790525076716351807) of Yammer and Slack: It’s nearly visually identical to Slack, but, like Yammer, Glue is organized around an inbox and threads. If Slack feels like a giant company-wide chatroom, Glue feels like centralized email inboxes, where internal email threads are organized into publicly browsable groups.[^2]

I…think I like it? It tries to be the best of both Slack and Yammer—structurally good bones, with a can of modern paint on top. It is lighter than email, and less insular, but more organized than the overcrowded airport terminal [that Slack traps us in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_(TV_series)#Premise) every day. Though I don’t think Glue will “reinvent workplace communication”—there are more dead startups buried under that tombstone than just about any other—it has as good of a shot as any.

Or, it did. Because Glue came out this year, in 2024. And if an app comes out in 2024, it can’t just be a clever new approach to a classic problem; it has to be “[AI-powered](https://www.semafor.com/article/05/24/2024/paypal-mafias-david-sacks-launches-ai-powered-glue-work-chat-app-to-rival-slack).” Glue can’t be a communication tool for people; it has to be for “[virtual team members](https://x.com/GlueAI/status/1790525082668028394)” too. Startups can’t be a software business; they have to be an “[AI company](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/david-sacks-glue-ai-slack-microsoft-teams-alternative/).” Their launch announcements have to have headlines about how they’re “[AI native](https://x.com/GlueAI/status/1790525076716351807),” and they have to bury the interesting parts of what they’re building in the [seventh post of the thread](https://x.com/GlueAI/status/1790525091446718639). This is Silicon Valley after ChatGPT: Nothing is complete without AI. 

Why? Why do we have to do this? How many good products are going to get ruined by [unnecessary chatbots](https://benn.substack.com/p/ai-is-coming-for-your-favorite-products)? How many simple ideas have been left on the cutting room floor because they couldn’t be shoehorned into the “age of AI?” How many promising startups went unfunded because “if you have a great product in the AI space, [you can raise a Series A right away](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/david-sacks-glue-ai-slack-microsoft-teams-alternative/#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20a%20great%20product%20in%20the%20AI%20space%2C%20you%20can%20raise%20a%20Series%20A%20right%20away.),” but the opposite is probably true if you are building something without AI? And how many [good deals are out](https://benn.substack.com/p/long-on-shovels-short-on-gold#:~:text=In%20other%20words,is%20undervalued.) there because venture capitalists have been hypnotized by all this hocus pocus, and are ignoring the boring companies that aren’t draping themselves in the latest fad?

Be the change you want to see in the world, I guess. 

Are you starting a company that *isn’t *using AI? Are you here to make something dull, like a messaging app that still expects people to write their own posts? Are you creating a SaaS app that’s algorithm for organizing its feeds is “put the newest stuff at the top?” Do you [employ real people](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-chatbots-bad-customer-service-botshit-inaccurate-information-airlines-accountability-2024-7) as support agents? Benn.ventures wants to give you money.

Not much, mind you. Benn.ventures currently has an IRA in assets under management. And we’re down to a part-time salary and $800 in an HSA in dry powder. 

But raising venture capital isn’t just about raising money—it’s also about [collecting endorsements](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/co-sign#:~:text=Paul%20Graham%20%E2%80%94%20an,world%20and%20theirs.). It’s about proving that you were one of the chosen few, selected by the ruthlessly exacting experts at Sequoia, at Benchmark, at Y Combinator. 

We don’t have a storied track record of success. And we definitely aren’t experts. But we are grumpy. We are selective, not because we know what we are doing, but because we are haters. We are not optimistic about the future. Given the current state of the world, you shouldn’t be building a company; you should be stocking up on beans and building a bunker. There was no CRM in *The Road*. 

[People have said](https://investing1012dot0.substack.com/p/cultivating-cults#:~:text=investing%20should%20be%20an%20act%20of%20taking%20your%20world%20view%20and%20deploying%20capital%20to%20try%20and%20shape%20reality%20to%20that%20world%20view) that investing is “taking your world view and deploying capital to try and shape reality to that world view.” My worldview is that I don’t like stuff. Your idea is bad; [change my mind](https://imgflip.com/i/94490c). I tried to build something, [wasn’t so good at it](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-a-startup-feels#:~:text=In%20hindsight%2C%20it%20was%20a%20machine%20that%20I%20was%20perhaps%20constitutionally%20unfit%20to%20run), and am now bitter about it. A better person would say, “It’s time to try a new position, and to pay my experiences forward to the next generation.”

Nonsense. Silicon Valley is a status game, and status is zero sum. Much easier to tear others down than build ourselves up—to be Simon Cowell; Oscar the Grouch; Eeyore; Anton Ego; the Grinch, before his heart grew three sizes that day. Seeing successful young people zoom past us on the social hierarchy makes us feel bad, and our egos are fragile. We will never tell you we’re [rooting for you from the sidelines](https://hunterwalk.medium.com/when-a-vc-passes-and-is-wrong-real-talk-between-me-and-ethenas-ceo-roxanne-petraeus-3f79fdc56fc1) because we’d rather you fail—we don’t want our LPs asking us why we passed on a big winner, and you failing makes us feel a little bit better about ourselves.[^3]

Still, we’re greedy. You can apparently make [a lot of money doing this](https://x.com/JoshuaOgundu/status/1811092397088199025), but you have to invest in *something*. So we will take your call, [expecting to write a scathing review](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-guys-american-kitchen-bar-in-times-square.html), but holding out hope for finding a [few simple flavors from a bygone era](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxpm-xYSvkU). 

## Frequently asked questions about benn.ventures

Pessimism? A general disdain for computers? We are a [specialized firm](https://www.allocator.one/press/blog/blog-content/blog-the-power-of-niche-how-specialized-first-time-vc-managers-can-outperform-generalists), and our specialization is skepticism.[^4] You can comfortably walk into a pitch knowing there’s no pressure to convince us to like your company, because our default position is that we don’t like your company. 

We will tell you we’re excited to learn more about it, but we aren’t. We would like your pitch to be over; we would like to go to a long lunch; we would like to have a margarita. We would like to hurry up and make enough money so that we can retire. They say that there is no motivation like desperation, and we are up to our elbows in despair. 

That [we like the stock.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/we-like-the-stock-the-anatomy-of-a-meme-11612542783)

Nobody. My parents? I am still on a Verizon family plan, and I think I use their Apple TV. Benn.ventures is not corrupted by the moneyed elite; we don’t invest on behalf of the one percent. 

If you would like to invest, however, we are open to bringing on new LPs. The fee structure is simple: 2 and 10 for 10—I charge a 2 percent management fee and an industry-low 10 percent carry, provided that you find 10 more LPs to invest behind you. It is critical that you do this last part, because we need their investments to pay your returns.

Yes! Unless we believe that a company could be making us more money without the founder. But, look, that’s just business. Don’t take it personally. We are 100 percent behind our founders, so long as their interests align with our own. 

However, firing CEOs and writing punishing term sheets that aren’t copied [directly from the YC website](https://www.ycombinator.com/series_a_term_sheet) requires lawyers, effort, and a fair amount of business acumen. At benn.ventures, we have none of these things. We might *try* some weird 12-dimensional gambits, because what’s the fun of being a day trader without doing kooky trades, and what’s the fun of being in charge if you don’t instigate some boardroom shenanigans. They will probably fail though, because of a mix of bumbling incompetence and a sort of uninspired laziness. Just because we want to be Machevellian doesn’t mean we’ll be able to pull it off. 

Imagine what can be, unburdened by what has been. 

We believe in the creative power of founders, and will use every resource we can to make you successful. We want to help you chase your dreams, and want to [make those dreams even bigger](https://x.com/nealkhosla/status/1811453327445754022). We aren’t professional investors, but operators who haven’t stopped hustling. We want to be the first person that you call when something goes wrong. We don’t just want to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange with you; we want to be in the trenches during your toughest moments too.

Hahaha no we don’t. We are venture capitalists because that stuff is hard. In the [arena](https://x.com/chamath/status/1693992134796603477), your face gets marred by dust and sweat and blood; there is effort, and shortcoming, and, often, failure. We’re not trying to get our delicate hands that dirty. We didn’t come to Silicon Valley to struggle; [we came to succeed](https://benn.substack.com/i/146084626/one-ruler-to-reign-them-all).[^5] When something goes wrong, we want to be told about it after the fact, at the holiday party, long after it’s fixed. Our website [doesn’t have a phone number](https://www.benchmark.com/) for a reason. 

I mean, no. There is a [minimalist website](https://benn.ventures/) for old angel investments,[^6] but my books are an “Investments” tab in a Google sheet that’s called “Finances.”[^7] There is no legal entity called benn.ventures. Does making a joke about starting a venture firm violate SEC regulations? I don’t know, because benn.ventures doesn’t exist, and definitely doesn’t employ any lawyers who can answer that question.

Still, it *could *be real, partly because I’m not above selling my soul for attention on the internet, partly because working in venture does sound abstractly interesting,[^8] and partly—and this is the point that this very long preamble is ultimately leading to—because *what else do you do? *

It feels like we’re starting to reach an odd frontier in the evolution of the Silicon Valley data professional. In the early 2010s, the “rockstar ninja” data scientist was all the rage; then, people became VPs of data and analytics. When that [career path stalled](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-missing-analytics-executive?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=Among%20the%20data,left%20it%20for.)—people can only build a data culture at so many 100-person series B SaaS startups before they get bored—[analysts started companies](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/keep-data-council-weird?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web#:~:text=A%20lot%20has,that%20in%20mind.). Now, as that era fades, those same people will inevitably start wondering what they should do next. 

The mid-level data executive merry-go-round is a plateau. Moving into other roles, like operations, finance, or product, feels like a soft reset. Starting a company is hard, and a pretty extreme “default” step. Joining Cigna as the Chief Analytics and Innovation Officer is a good way to get invited to Gartner panels. There are choices, but they’re all a bit uncomfortable.[^9]

So what happens to all of us now? I don’t know. But some release valve will have to open somewhere, because a huge cohort of data people are about to be halfway through their second decade in the industry, and a bunch of them are going to wonder where they go next. And as much as I’d enjoy the joke, the world probably doesn’t actually need a [Statler and Waldorf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14njUwJUg1I) Capital Partners.

[^1]: There were actually many feeds, organized by groups, which were analogous to Slack channels.

[^2]: This might be the best way to understand Yammer. It wasn’t a chat app, but an email app that grouped emails by team or subject, and put those emails in central feed that everyone could read and respond to.

[^3]: In fairness, you’ll probably do the same? Our rejection letters will put a chip on your shoulder, and you will want to prove us wrong. Maybe that’s the real play here; we’re just a feeder firm for [Spite Capital](https://x.com/josh_wills/status/1529958823749816321).

[^4]: We also have hobbies that aren’t triathlons, Rapha, and Sun Valley.

[^5]: We *do* [want to choose](https://x.com/DavidSacks/status/1816563273350938906), and we want to choose the podcast.

[^6]: It’s in plain HTML and there is no favicon. Because we are purists who have real work to do, and can’t be bothered by whimsical things like [colors](https://nfdg.com/) and [fonts](https://www.conviction.com/) and cascading style sheets.

[^7]: Other tabs include lists of stuff to sell on Facebook Marketplace, and gift cards that I need to spend.

[^8]: Of course, when I was in college, working for McKinsey also sounded abstractly interesting. Fly around the country, parachute into important meetings, fire off some advice, and assign all the work that needs to be done to other people. But the reality—mostly formatting decks, I’m told—is awful.

[^9]: Another possibility is that VP is the appropriate plateau for the Silicon Valley data professional. It’s perhaps not the position we want, but [it’s the position we deserve](https://benn.substack.com/p/disband-the-analytics-team).

# The second wolf

*Let me know how I can help myself. *

Inside every venture capitalist there are two wolves.

The first loves to learn. They have the best job in the world, they tell themselves, because they get to work with so many smart and driven people. They never meant to become a VC, but now that they are, they can’t imagine doing anything else. They want you to [let them know how they can be helpful](https://vcstarterkit.substack.com/p/in-defense-of-let-me-know-how-i-can), and they genuinely mean it. They miss their days in the trenches: They want to roll up their sleeves and review product mocks, brainstorm about the new marketing strategy, and work through customer objections in the sales team’s deal review. They admire startups’ grit, founders’ creativity, and are grateful for the work of the talented teams that work so hard to make them money.

The second wolf believes they could do it better themselves. They think the first wolf is VC Manager Mode: Gentle outsourcing, and hoping that startups figure out on their own what the second wolf knew all along. They think the friendly builder is a useful brand, but their real heroes are the ruthless killers: Larry Ellison; [Frank Slootman](https://www.amazon.com/Amp-Unlocking-Hypergrowth-Expectations-Intensity/dp/1119836115); Gordon Gekko; [Jordan Belfort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQleT6BtCbE). They want to be remembered as hard truth tellers; they want to write the next “[RIP Good Times](https://articles.sequoiacap.com/rip-good-times)” memo; they want [to be feared](https://reactionwheel.net/2021/11/your-boards-of-directors-is-probably-going-to-fire-you.html) as much as loved. They want to be [Jeremy Irons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXAYNppypVI) in *Margin Call*, and they hope their speech [gets leaked](https://www.techemails.com/). They think the CEO is screwing things up, and that the solutions are obvious—a sharper pencil, a tighter belt, a deeper cut—but the CEO doesn’t have the backbone to do what needs to be done. Back in their day, the kids these days wouldn’t have made it.

For the second wolf, it’s about money—but it’s mostly about optics. Because the second wolf [is insecure](https://kellblog.com/2011/06/08/interest-misalignments-in-silicon-valley-startups/#:~:text=Benchmarking%3A%C2%A0%20I%20need%20to%20make%20%2450M.%C2%A0%20(Because%20my%20roommate%20at%20Stanford%20made%20%2450M%20and%20I%E2%80%99m%20smarter%20than%20he%20is.)). Their GSB classmate just made the [Midas List](https://www.forbes.com/lists/midas/), but everyone knows that’s just pay-to-play PR, right? They’re on a board with a partner from Sequoia, and they’re not that impressed. They’re jealous that they weren’t invited to the All-In Summit; they’re secretly happy that [Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner’s podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6Jwmvh8DLmc9WZsrCIgsW_5IDWncrqV5) hasn’t really taken off. They tell themselves that they’d have a bigger following if they wanted to, but they care about building. They prefer to keep a low profile; to be heads down; to do the work, helping founders, adding value. They’re thinking about launching a newsletter. 

The second wolf will shiv you for a dollar. They will shiv you to show off for their friends. They will shiv you to remind you that they can. They will shiv you because their other investments are struggling, because their senior partners are whispering about their performance, and because they think your shivved scalp will impress their bosses. The first wolf will say this is the worst part of the job, and they are doing what they have to do for their limited partners. The second wolf will shiv you for the thrill of the shiv. 

Inside every venture capitalist, there are both wolves. Nobody is singular, nor does a company or CEO need one type of advice. Sometimes, there are opportunities, and you need a collaborator to help chase them. And sometimes there are problems, and [you need the second wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN12-hJI7ws) to solve them. You need tough love; stern feedback; a stick to fear, rather than a carrot to hope for.

But I will say this: Nobody is as good of an actor as they think they are. You can smell when someone is cosplaying [a character from a blog post](https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html), or when they’re [preening for someone else in the room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NT3GnLUkro), or when they’re panicking about their own job because they [don’t know what else to do](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-a-startup-feels). You can tell when the confidence is fake, or the bloodlust is real. You can tell when someone is desperate to prove that they’re useful and [not just rich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rARN6agiW7o).
